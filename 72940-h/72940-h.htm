<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BRITISH_NAVY_IN_THE_REVOLUTION">THE BRITISH NAVY IN THE REVOLUTION</h2>


<p>In the study of the events of the Revolution, one cannot but be
impressed with the important share which the movements and
achievements of the navy of Great Britain, had in deciding the military
events. It has often been remarked that had King George been as well
served ashore, as he was afloat, the Revolution might have ended very
differently. Therefore, it may be assumed that the history of that great
struggle will not be entirely complete until the work done at sea on both
sides is more fully dealt with in its bearing on the land operations.</p>

<p>In such a study, the material facts are available to an extent which
does not seem to be widely known; for in the great Public Record Office
of the Crown, in Chancery Lane, London, are stored away the actual
orders, reports and correspondence of the naval officials of that period,
and in addition the actual log books of the vessels. The former include
Admirals’ despatches, filed in the Navy Side, under the heading “Admiralty
Secretary, In Letters,” and those relating to the strife with the
thirteen colonies, during the period 1774 to 1784 inclusive, are indexed
by the name of the “North American Station,” and numbered 484, 485,
486, 487 and 488. Of the mass of interesting material therein I was
able, during a short visit, only to examine hastily one great package,
which I found teeming with details of the affairs of the time, the confidential
communications not only of the superior, but of subordinate
officers on different stations, captured papers, reports of spies, and lists
of captured vessels, men, and goods.</p>

<p>These papers are entirely free of access to any person, the only
requirement being that they shall be examined in public, that no ink shall
be used in copying, and that they are returned after every session.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>Up to a date one hundred years ago, the papers are available without
any introduction or order, but if the enquirer should desire those of
more recent date, a special order must be obtained. The courtesy of
Sir Henry Maxwell-Lyte, K. C. B., Deputy Keeper of the Records, and
of W. Stamp, his assistant must be acknowledged by myself, and will undoubtedly
be experienced by other enquirers into these matters.</p>

<p>It is extremely interesting to the student of history thus to handle
and read the very documents which, received by the then authorities from
the scene of actual hostilities, did so much in themselves to affect the
course of events.</p>

<p>These official naval documents may be supplemented by examination
of the contemporary military papers of the period, those emanating from
the pseudo-civil governors of the colonies containing especially interesting
matter.</p>

<p>Of these a number of the despatches of Governor Tryon to Lord
George Germain, will be found in the Colonial Office Records, under
heading “America and West Indies.” Those of 1780, for instance, are
indexed No. 189—a bundle which contains some fascinating papers,
such as the original reports of spies, a number of these signed by one
especially active scoundrel whose signature, A. Z., is frequent, and his
suggestions for the confounding of the American forces full of a lively
personal interest. On the reports of deserters and spies, many favorable
prognostications are founded by the writers of these despatches, and much
may be learned of the policy and directions which led to some of the
stirring events of that period.</p>

<p>Another source of information of a most detailed character is the
large collection of log-books of the various war vessels. These were, in
those days, kept not only by the Captains, and by the Lieutenants in command,
but separate books were also kept by the sailing masters. Of the
two former, those of the Lieutenants being practically duplicates of the
Commanders’, have been destroyed, but the Captains’ and Masters’ books
are preserved.</p>

<p>These books are in the original bindings and are of a most interesting
character, carefully noting the time and nature of every occurrence
in which the ship took part, as well as the surrounding circumstances of
weather, sea and course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>From them may thus be obtained not only much new information
of the details of actions, but confirmative and corrective matters of time
and place.</p>

<p>In the course of a study of the operations of the British marine in
the waters of New York, I found myself confronted by contradictions of
a very annoying nature in the published accounts of the events of 1776,
but upon reference to these log books many of these points were fully
cleared up. Of some of these I hope at a future date to be able to give
details, but the purpose of this article being to afford to others the knowledge
of the existence and accessibility of the source of this information, I
shall here give only the index numbers of the log-books of the most
important vessels, which bore a prominent part in the Revolution.</p>

<p>The well-known names of the redoubtable men-of-war, frigates,
armed brigs and schooners will recall to my readers events in which these
took part, and the significant gaps in the logs of some point to the disasters
or captures of which they became the victims.</p>

<p>Of these it may be noted that the <i>Asia</i> was conspicuous around New York,
particularly in the summer of 1776, when a shot from her caused the
only bloodshed of which Governor’s Island has been the scene, although
it has been a military station since 1800. One of her cannon-balls took
off an arm of an American soldier, in April, 1776.</p>

<p>Another of her shots penetrated the roof of Fraunces’ Tavern, in
Broad street, New York. It was preserved until a few years ago, when
it mysteriously disappeared. Freneau, in his <i>Petition of Hugh Gaine</i>
refers to the incident:</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At first we supposed it was only a sham</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till he drove a round ball through the roof of Black Sam.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Eagle</i> came very near furnishing the first proof in history of the
efficiency of submarine boats or torpedoes. It is part of the history of the
Revolution that Bushnell’s “Turtle” only failed to blow her up, as she lay
off Governor’s Island in August, 1776, because of her bottom being coppered,
and hence affording no chance of attachment of the “Turtle” by
a huge screw, as the inventor had intended.</p>

<p>The <i>Duchess of Gordon</i> was Tryon’s headquarters at the same time.
The <i>Experiment</i>, <i>Thunder</i> and <i>Solebay</i> were conspicuous in the unsuccessful
attack on Charleston in June, 1776, and the <i>Pearl</i>, <i>Phœnix</i>, <i>Rose</i>, <i>Roebuck</i>
and <i>Tartar</i> were particularly active near New York during the whole
war.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The foregoing are by no means all of the vessels engaged in the war
of the Revolution, of which I have gathered references to no less than one
hundred and twenty-two, and there were doubtless many more engaged in
those operations east and south of which I have been unable to make a
close study.</p>

<p>These will, however, serve to indicate some of the material available,
and perhaps afford some historical enquirers the means of adding
to their information.</p>

<p>The administration of Governor George Clinton is very important
on the side of Constitutional growth, since it is now that the General
Assembly for the first time clearly enunciates the principles
of self-government and the right not only to vote the taxes but to determine
the ways in which the money shall be expended. In 1747 the colonies were
engaged in war with France, and it was of the greatest importance that
the outposts and fortified places on the Canadian border should be
adequately garrisoned and amply supplied with provisions and munitions
of war. Clinton was striving to assert the principle of royal prerogative
in the matter of money-bills, a right which Governor Clarke had allowed
to slip away from him. This attempt the General Assembly naturally
resisted, and as a result is reproached by the Governor with neglecting
to provide him with the money necessary to keep the province properly
defended against the French. In the Minutes of the General Assembly
of Oct. 8th, 1747, appears the following Message from the Governor,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<i>Gentlemen</i>,<br>
</p>

<p>By your Votes I understand you are going upon Things very foreign
to what I recommended you: I will receive nothing from you at this
critical Juncture, but what relates to the Message I last sent you, viz.
By all Means, immediately to take the preservation of your Frontiers,
and the Fidelity of the Indians, into consideration: The Loss of a Day
may have fatal Consequences; when that is over, you may have Time
enough to go upon any other Matters.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">G. Clinton.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The next day the House took into consideration the Governor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
Message, and after a rather theatric locking of the door and laying the
key on the table (as though, as Clinton says in his Message of Oct. 13th,
some one were attempting to break in,) drew up a set of Resolutions to
be delivered to the Governor, in which his Message was declared to be
an attempt to subvert the rights, privileges, and immunities of the House.
In addition a long document, called “A Humble Remonstrance of the
House on the present State and Condition of the Colony,” was ordered
carried by a committee to the Governor. This document, which had
taken a Committee several days to draw up, was a long and detailed statement
of the Assembly’s side of the quarrel and an attempt to show that the
wretched state of the colony’s affairs was due to the tactics of delay made
use of by the Governor and not to any fault of the Assembly which was
very willing to grant money provided it had some assurance that the
sums voted would be expended for the purposes designated. This
Remonstrance the Governor refused to receive, and by his Secretary
directed James Parker, the official printer, not to print it in the proceedings
of the Assembly; this direction was not heeded by Parker, a step
which brought out from the Governor the following Order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By His Excellency the Honourable George Clinton, Captain
General and Governor in Chief, of the Province of New York, etc.</p>

<p>To Mr. James Parker, Printer to the General Assembly of the
Province of New York.</p>

<p>Whereas some Persons, calling themselves a Committee of the
General Assembly of this Province, came into an Apartment of my
House, on the 9th instant, while I was engaged in my private affairs;
and without the least previous Notice, one of them offered to read a
large bundle of Paper, which he said was a Remonstrance from that
House, and desired my Leave to read the same, which I absolutely
refused, or to have it left with me; and whereas the Speaker of the said
General Assembly hath, in disregard to my Authority and Person,
ordered the same to be printed by you in their Votes, although I forewarned
you by my Secretary not to do it; but as you afterwards signified
to him, that a Verbal Order was not sufficient to forbid you printing any
Thing to that Purpose;</p>

<p>I do hereby in his Majesty’s Name, expressly forbid you or any
other person in this Province, to re-print or otherwise publish, the said
Paper, called, a Remonstrance of the General Assembly of this Province,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
as you and they shall answer the same at your and their Peril; the said
Paper, containing many false, scandalous and malicious Aspersions on
me, as Governor of this Province; and I do hereby, further require you
to give publick Notice of this my Order, by publishing the same in your
next News-Paper; and for your so doing, this shall be the warrant.</p>

<p>Given under my Hand, at the City of New York, October
24th, 1747.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">G. Clinton.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This Order having duly appeared in Parker’s New York Gazette
and Post Boy, the Speaker on Oct. 26th reported it to the House and
requested “that the House would vindicate his Conduct therein.”
Accordingly Parker was ordered to appear before the body. He came
the next day and produced Clinton’s order in justification of his action,
and the Assembly then passed the following resolutions;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“Resolved, Nemine Contradicente, That it is the undoubted Right
of the People of this Colony, to know the Proceedings of their Representatives
in General Assembly, and that any Attempt to prevent their Proceedings
being printed and published, is a Violation of the Rights and
Liberties of the People of this Colony.</p>

<p>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente, That any Attempt to prohibit
the printing or re-printing of any of the Proceedings of this House, is
an infringement of the Privileges of this House, and of the People they
represent.</p>

<p>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente, That the Humble Remonstrance
of this House, of the 9th instant, though his Excellency, (contrary
to the uninterrupted Usage in such Cases,) refused to receive it,
was, notwithstanding, a regular Proceeding of this House.</p>

<p>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente, That his Excellency’s Order to
forbid the printing or re-printing the said Remonstrance, is unwarrantable,
arbitrary and illegal, and not only an open and manifest Violation
of the Privileges of this House, but also of the Liberty of the Press, and
evidently tends to the utter subversion of all the Rights and Liberties of
this House, and of the People they represent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente, That Mr. Speaker’s ordering
the said Remonstrance to be printed with the Votes and Proceedings of
this House, is regular, and entirely consistent with the Duty of his Office
as Speaker of this House.”</p>

<p>On Nov. 12th a further step was taken, when Col. Lewis Morris
made the following Motion, which was carried;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The late Order in Parker’s Paper, ordering him as Printer of this
House, not to publish or print the Proceedings of this House, is an
Attempt to deprive the People of these Colonies of their Liberties; I
therefore move, that we order him to re-print our Humble Remonstrance
to his Excellency, and that he deliver ten Copies to each member of this
House, that our Constituents may know, that it is our firm Resolution
to preserve the Liberty of the Press, and to communicate our proceedings
to them, that they may judge of our Conduct.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Governor up to this time had said nothing on the subject, but
in his Speech dissolving the Assembly on Nov. 25,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> he breaks his silence
and argues the matter at length. He begins by saying that their action
has a very dangerous likeness to a desire to grasp the executive power, a
result which would be destructive of their dependency on Great Britain,
and of which the people of Great Britain might become jealous. He
then goes on to show that their conduct is not only wanting in respect to
their Sovereign, since the Governor is his representative, but even wanting
in ordinary manliness and honesty, since they are striking at one who,
(on account of his position,) cannot retaliate. The question as to whether
the paper is not a false, scandalous and malicious libel he left to his
superiors in England. He ends his statement of the matter, “As to the
popular Out-cry you endeavor to raise, of the Liberty of the Press, I shall
only say, that certainly this Liberty, as well as any other may be abused,
to the injury of others; if an injury is done, a proper Remedy ought to be
applied; and such a Remedy can never be thought a Restraint of any just
Liberty. I am persuaded that no considerate man can think, that I
offered any Obstruction to the Liberty of the Press, by forbidding the
Printer to publish that one Paper at his Peril; if no Peril in doing it,
neither the author nor Publishers of it can suffer by the Order; the
proper Judges may in Time show, whether I did a Service or a Disservice
to any, by such Warning.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>
<p>The Twenty-fifth Assembly came together in the Spring of 1748
and the old quarrel was resumed. On reassembling for the second Session
in September an Address was drawn up in which former complaints
were reiterated, and which the Governor refused to receive.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
Address was then printed in the Votes and Proceedings of the Assembly,
and on Nov. 12th the Governor, in proroguing the Assembly, took
occasion to complain of their method of procedure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In whatever your Governor and you differ, there is a legal Method
for Redress. In my Message to you, I told you that I would do the
Justice, to send a Copy of that Paper, which you call an Address, to his
Majesty’s Ministers; which is sending it to the proper Tribunal for
Redress, if I have done you any injury, by my refusing to receive it; but
you seem to decline this legal Method; and by your publishing that
Paper, under the name of an Address, in your Votes, and afterwards in
a publick News Paper, published by the Printer of your Votes; you seem
to place the dernier Resort in all Disputes between you and your Governor,
in the Populace; how his Majesty may take this, or how a Parliament
of Great Britain, may take your claiming, not only the Privileges
of Parliament, but Privileges far beyond what any House of Commons
ever claimed, deserves your most serious consideration.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Governor George Clinton was succeeded by Sir Danvers Osborne in
the summer of 1753, but the latter meeting with a violent death the government
devolved on James Delancey, the Lieutenant-Governor. The
latter in his speech at the coming together of the Assembly took occasion
to quote certain paragraphs from the Instructions given to Sir Danvers
Osborne. These would naturally be of interest to all in the colony, and
Hugh Gaine, the printer of the New York Mercury, published the paragraphs
in his next issue. This provoked comment and the Assembly at
once took action.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The House being informed that one Hugh Gaine, a printer, in the
City of New York, had presumed in his Paper, called, the New York
Mercury, of Monday, November the 12th, 1753, No. 66, to print and
publish Part of the Proceedings of this House, particularly several
articles of his Majesty’s Instructions to his Excellency, the late Sir Danvers
Osborne, Baronet; and the said Paper being produced, and read,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>Ordered, That the said Hugh Gaine, attend this House To-morrow,
at 10 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the Serjeant at Arms, attending this House, serve
the said Hugh Gaine, with a Copy of this Order forthwith.”</p>
</div>

<p>Next day Hugh Gaine appeared at the Bar of the House; “being
asked, whether he was the Printer of the Paper, called the New York
Mercury, he acknowledged that he was; and then being asked, by what
Authority he had therein printed and published an Extract of the Votes
of this House; answered, that he had no Authority for doing it, and
knew not that he did amiss in doing so; and that he was very sorry that
he had offended the House, and humbly asked their Pardon.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The result was that after the matter had been discussed in the
House the printer was called in, reprimanded, and allowed to go, on paying
the costs.</p>

<p>In 1756 James Parker, who had in 1747 braved the wrath of Governor
Clinton in order to obey the Speaker of the House, himself fell
into disgrace. Parker and Wm. Weyman were at this time joint owners
of the New York Gazette, or the Weekly Post Boy, and on the 15th of
March, published an article entitled “Observations on the Circumstances
and Conduct of the People in the Counties of Ulster and Orange, in the
Province of New York.”</p>

<p>The Assembly at its meeting on the 16th took the matter up on the
ground that it reflected on the conduct and composition of the House.
The Serjeant at Arms was directed to bring the printers to the Bar.
Parker was out of town, but Weyman appeared, and being asked how he
had come to print it said that he done so merely as a piece of news, and
went on to say that he believed it to have been written by the Rev.
Hezekiah Watkins, a clergyman of Newburgh, Ulster County, and that
he was heartily sorry for the mistake. The House then;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Resolved, That the Piece ... contains sundry insolent,
false, and malicious Expressions, calculated to misrepresent the conduct
of the Representatives of the People of this Colony.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the Author of the said Piece has attempted by
false and malicious Misrepresentations, to irritate the People of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Colony against their Representatives in General Assembly, and is therefore
guilty of a high Misdemeanor and a Contempt of the Authority of
this House.</p>

<p>Resolved, That James Parker and Wm. Weyman, for having
published the said Piece in their Weekly Paper, are guilty of a high Misdemeanor
and a Contempt of the Authority of this House.</p>

<p>Resolved, That James Parker and Wm. Weyman, be for their
said offense, taken into the Custody of the Sergeant at Arms attending
this House.”</p>
</div>

<p>Four days later Parker presented a petition setting forth that on
receiving news of what had happened he had at once returned and surrendered
himself; that the writer of the piece was Mr. Watkins, as he
could easily prove; and the petition goes on to say “that when he received
the said Piece, he thought it contained sundry indecent Expressions, and
thereupon struck them out, but is sorry that he left sundry Matters, which
though they seemed not to be malignant to him at the Time, appear now
to be so; that he humbly confesses his fault in printing the said Piece;
that he had no design to give Offense thereby, promised to be more circumspect
for the future, and humbly begs the pardon of the honourable
House: And therefore humbly praying (having long experienced the
Kindness of the Honourable House) a Dismission from the Custody in
which he now is.”</p>

<p>A week later the House took the matter up, and a motion to that
effect having been made by Capt. Richard, Parker and Weyman were
discharged from custody.</p>

<p>The House having been prorogued shortly after this, it was not
until it came together again that the matter of the Revd. Mr. Watkins
received attention. On Oct. 15, 1756, a motion was made by Capt. Walton
that Mr. Watkins be ordered to attend the House. Accordingly he
appeared on the 22nd and admitted the fact of authorship said that he
had had no intention of acting disrespectfully but that the condition of
affairs in Ulster and Orange Counties had caused his zeal for the welfare
of the people to carry him too far; and that he was heartily sorry.
In spite of his explanation he was ordered into the custody of the Sergeant
at Arms, and the Minutes of the next day (Oct. 23,) set forth his
Petition in which he went over at greater length the explanation he had
given orally the day before. After some discussion of the matter he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
was ordered to be brought to the Bar of the House where he was reprimanded
by the Speaker and then discharged.</p>

<p>Another case very similar to the last was that of Samuel Townsend,
a Justice of the Peace of Queen’s County. Some of the so-called
“Neutral French” had been quartered upon Long Island, and Samuel
Townsend wrote, in reference to their uncared for condition and misfortunes,
a letter to the Speaker which the latter laid before the Assembly
on Mar. 16, 1758, and Townsend was ordered to appear and explain the
matter. Having examined him the House<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Resolved, That the letter ... contains sundry indecent
and insolent Expressions, reflecting on the Honour, Justice and
Authority of this House.</p>

<p>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente, That the said Samuel Townsend,
for writing and sending the said Letter, is guilty of a high Misdemeanor
and a most daring Insult, on the Honour, Justice, and Authority
of this House.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the said Samuel Townsend remain in the Custody
of the Sergeant at Arms attending this House.”</p>
</div>

<p>Next day a long petition was presented in which Townsend begged
“leave, humbly to express his Uneasiness and Sorrow, for having wrote
the said Letter; and at the same time, to declare that he did not intend
thereby to cast any Reflection upon the Conduct or Dignity of this House,
and that he shall for the future be more cautious to avoid every occasion
of exposing himself to their Censure or Reproof.</p>

<p>Your Petitioner therefore most humbly Prays, that the sincere
Acknowledgement of his Sorrow and Uneasiness may prevail upon this
honourable House, to treat him with all that Levity and Compassion,
to which the Innocence of his Intention herein declared, and the real
Regard he has for the Honour of this House, may entitle him, and discharge
him from the Custody of the Sergeant at Arms.”</p>

<p>After this had been read Townsend was ordered to the Bar, and,
having been reprimanded by the Speaker, was discharged.</p>

<p>The growing dissatisfaction with the home government was fanned
into open opposition when the news arrived in the colonies that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Ministry, not content with the restrictions which it had placed upon the
growing trade of the Atlantic coast towns, had decided to introduce
direct taxation by a duty on stamped paper. The popular press in New
York was filled with articles against the Stamp Act, but these articles
were far exceeded in number and influence by handbills which were posted
throughout the town, and read and discussed by all the inhabitants. The
Assembly passed all this over, in silence, tacitly permitting what but a
short time before would have brought any one suspected of complicity in
the writing or printing of the same to its Bar.</p>

<p>But a peculiarly offensive piece of writing finally was taken notice
of. It was about a month after the riot of Nov. 1st, 1765, (when the
Stamp Act was due to go into effect,) on which occasion some damage
had been done to the fort and batteries, that,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “Mr. Lott, Clerk to
this House, presented on the 26th instant, a sealed Letter to the House,
directed in the words following, viz. ‘To the General Assembly of the
Province of New York.’ Which Letter was delivered to him, the said
Lott, by his Clerk who had received it from a Person unknown; and was
enclosed in another Letter directed, ‘To Mr. Lott, Mercht. in New
York,’ and the same being read, was in the words following: ‘on Receiving
you are to read the in Closed in the open assembly of this Province
New York as you are Clark and whare of fail not on your perrel.</p>

</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And then the Letter addressed to the General Assembly being
opened and also read, was in the Words following: ‘Gentlemen of the
House of Representatives you are to consider what is to be Done first
Drawing of as much money from the Lieut. Governors Sallery as will
Repare the fort and on Spike the Guns on the Battery and the next a

</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The House then proceeded to the Consideration of the said
Letters, and having fully weighed and Examined the same;</p>

<p>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente,</p>

<p>That, said Letters are Libellous, Scandalous and Seditious, containing
many indecent and insolent Expressions, highly reflecting on the
Honour, Justice and Authority of, and an High Insult and Indignity
to this House; and are designed and calculated to inflame the Minds of
the good People of this Colony, against their Representatives in General
Assembly.</p>

<p>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente,</p>

<p>That the Author or Authors of the said Letters is, or are, guilty
of an High Misdemeanor and a most daring Insult on the Honour,
Justice, and Authority of this House.”</p>
</div>

<p>They then resolved to present an Address to the Governor calling
on him to offer a reward of &#163;50 for the discovery of the Author or
Authors, and say that the House will provide means to meet the expense.</p>

<p>Writing under date of Sept. 23, 1765 to Secretary Conway in England,
Lieutenant Governor Colden remarks on this general subject:<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Soon after it was known that Stamp Duties were by Act of Parliament
to be paid in the Colonies, virulent papers were published in the
Weekly Newspapers, filled with every falsehood that malice could invent
to serve their purpose of exciting the people to disobedience of the Laws
and to Sedition. At first they only denied the authority of Parliament
to lay internal taxes in the Colonies but at last they have denyed the Legislative
Authority of the Parliament in the Colonies, and these papers
continue to be published.</p>

<p>I agreed with the Gentlemen of the Council that considering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
present temper of the people this is not a proper time to prosecute the
printers and Publishers of the Seditious Papers. The Attorney General
likewise told me that he does not think himself safe to commence any
such Prosecution.”</p>
</div>

<p>And in another letter to Secretary Conway under date of Oct. 12,
1765,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he again refers to the matter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since the last which I had the honour to write to you of the 23d of
September, this town has remained quiet the inflammatory Papers continue
to be published, exciting the People to oppose the execution of the
Act of Parliament for laying a Stamp Duty in the Colonies. The most
remarkable of these Papers is enclosed. This was distributed along the
Post Roads by the Post Riders. I examined the Post Master in this
place to know how this came to be done. He assured me that it was
without his knowledge; that he had examined the Post Riders and found
that one or more Bundles of them were delivered at Woodbridge, New
Jersey, to the Post Rider, by James Parker Secretary to the General
Post Office in N. America. Parker was formerly a printer in this place
and has now a printing Press and continues to print occasionally. It is
believed that this Paper was printed by him. The Gentlemen of the
Council think it prudent at this time to delay making more particular
inquiry least it should be the occasion of raising the Mob which it is
thought proper by all means to avoid.”</p>

(1805-1845)</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Excerpts from an address by the late W. P. Ryman, Esq., of Wilkes-Barré, Pa., before the
Wyoming Historical and Geological Society.]</p>
</div>


<p class="ph4">THE EARLIEST SETTLERS AND THEIR IMPROVEMENTS</p>

<p>The difficulties of settling Dallas township were very great. It
was comparatively an easy thing to cut a path or road along the
banks of Toby’s Creek and find a way even to its source, but to
settle there alone, many miles from any clearing, and meet the wolves,
bears and other wild animals, which were terrible realities in those early
days, saying nothing of the still pending dread of the prowling Indian,
was a very serious undertaking.</p>

<p>When a small boy I heard Mr. Charles Harris, then an old man, tell
some of his early recollections, which ran back to about the time of the
battle and massacre of Wyoming. He told us of the Indians who once
came into the house where he and his mother were alone and demanded
food. There being nothing better they roasted a pumpkin before the fire
and scraped it off and ate it as fast as it became soft with cooking. He
also told us about his father’s first settling on the westerly side of Kingston
Mountain at what is still known as the “Harris Settlement” about
two miles north of Trucksville. He said that his father worked all the
first day felling trees and building a cabin. Night came on before the
cabin could be inclosed. With the darkness came a pack of wolves, and,
to protect his family, Mr. Harris built a fire and sat up all night to keep
it burning. The wolves were dazed and would not come near a fire, and
when daylight came they disappeared. To pass one night under such
circumstances required bravery, but to stay, build a house, clear a farm
and raise a family with such terrors constantly menacing exhibited a courage
that commands our highest esteem.</p>

<p>Among those who came in the first decade were Joseph Worthington
and wife—the latter a daughter of Jonathan Buckley. They came from
Connecticut in the year 1806 and settled near Harvey’s Lake. His first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
house was built of logs, and stood on the hill about a quarter of a mile
from the eastern inlet to Harvey’s Lake. When he first moved into that
country there was no road from Huntsville to Harvey’s Lake except a
bridle path. Mr. Worthington cut a way through and built a house
when his nearest neighbor was miles away and no clearings in sight anywhere.
Wolves were then very numerous and bold at night, and the
only way Mr. Worthington could protect his family from their assaults
was for all to climb the ladder to the second floor and pull the ladder up
after them. Mr. Worthington used to say that his life during those early
days was most lonely and disheartening.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE VILLAGE STORE</p>

<p>The best of the first stores in Dallas would hardly be dignified by
that name now. Only a few necessaries were kept in any of them, and
“necessaries” then had a much scantier meaning than now. A few of
the commonest and cheapest cotton cloths were kept in stock; the woolen
goods used for winter wear, for both men and women, were all homespun.
It took many years for the storekeepers to convince the farmers that they
could buy heavy clothes of part wool and part cotton that would be as
durable and cheaper than the all wool homespun. The time spent on the
latter was counted as nothing, and the argument failed. A few other
goods of kinds in daily use, such as coffee, tea, sugar, molasses, tobacco,
powder, shot and flints and rum were of course necessary to any complete
store. Hunting materials and supplies were in great demand. A
hunter’s outfit at that time was proverbially “a quarter pound of powder,
a pound of shot, a pint of rum and a flint.” The flint was the box of
matches of that day. Before the invention of the lucifer match, the matter
of keeping fire in a house, especially in winter time, was one of extreme
importance in that sparsely settled country. Everyone burned wood
then, about there, and fire was kept over night by covering a few “live
coals” with ashes in the fireplace. Sometimes this failed, and then, if no
flint and punk were at hand, some member of the family had to go to the
nearest neighbor, probably a mile or more away, and bring fire. It is not
difficult to imagine their sufferings during the winters in this respect.
Had food, clothing and other things been plenty and good, this hardship
could have been better endured; but they were not, and worst of all, there
were almost no means of procuring them. There was an abundance of
game and fish for a time, but they did not satisfy a civilized people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>


<p class="ph4">EARLY AGRICULTURE</p>

<p>The only plow in use then was the old-fashioned shovel plow. The
only iron about it was the blade, which was about the shape of an ordinary
round-pointed shovel. This was fastened to the lower end of an upright
post. To the post were attached handles to hold it with, and a beam or
tongue to which the team could be hitched. This plow was jabbed into
the ground here and there between roots, stumps and stones, and with it
a little dirt could be torn up now and then. There was no patent plow
in use then, nor could it be used there for many years after we settled in
Dallas. Nor could we use a cradle for cutting grain. At that time the
ground was so rough, and there were so many stumps and roots and
stones, that we had to harvest at first with a sickle.</p>


<p class="ph4">CROPS AND PIGEONS</p>

<p>Buckwheat was early introduced in Dallas, and was afterwards so
extensively raised there that the expression “Buckwheat-Dallas” was
frequently used by the way of marking this fact in connection with the
name. It is a summer grain and quick to mature. In ninety days from
the day when the crop is sowed it can be grown, matured, gathered,
ground and served on the table as food, or, as has been often remarked,
just in time to meet a three months’ note in bank. Another practical
benefit from raising this grain was that, in gathering it, a large quantity
of it shook off and was scattered over the fields. This afforded a most
attractive pigeon food, and during the fall and spring seasons, and often
during much of the winter, pigeons would flock in countless numbers all
over that country. They came in such quantities that it would be difficult
to exaggerate their numbers. When a boy I used to see flocks that
extended as far as the eye could reach, from end to end, and these long
strings or waves of birds would pass over so closely following each other
that sometimes two or three flocks could be seen at once, and some days
they were almost constantly flying over, and the noise of their wings was
not unlike the sound of a high wind blowing through a pine wood. They
cast a shadow as they passed over almost like a heavy cloud. Often they
flew so low as to be easily reached with an ordinary shotgun. The
skilled way of capturing them in large numbers, however, was with a
net. William or Daddy Emmons was a famous pigeon trapper as well
as fisherman. He used decoy pigeons. They were blind pigeons tied
to the ground at some desired spot, and when they heard the noise of large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
flocks flying overhead, they would flap their wings as if to fly away. Attracted
by this the flock would come down and settle near the decoys,
where plenty of buckwheat was always to be found. When a sufficient
number had settled and collected on the right spot, Mr. Emmons, who
was concealed in a bush or bough house near by, would spring his net over
them quickly and fasten them within. After properly securing the net,
the work of killing them began. It was done in an instant by crushing
their heads between the thumb and fingers. Hundreds were often caught
and killed in this way at one spring of the net. Pigeons were so plenty
that some hunters cut off and saved the breast only, and threw the rest
away.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE OLD LOG CHURCH</p>

<p>Of all the occasions in the church, none ever approached such intensity
of feeling and excitement as the “revival” or “protracted meeting”
season.</p>

<p>These meetings usually began late in the fall, about the time or just
after the farmers had finished their fall work. The first symptom usually
appeared in the slightly extra fervor which the minister put in his sermons
and prayers on Sunday. Then a special prayer meeting would be set for
some evening during the week. Other special meetings soon followed,
so that, if all things were favorable, the revival or “protracted meeting”
would be at a white heat within two or three weeks. In the meantime
the fact would become known far and near, and the “protracted meeting”
would be the leading event of the neighborhood. If the sleighing
became good, parties would be formed miles away to go sleigh riding with
this “protracted meeting” as their objective visiting point, often from idle
curiosity or for want of something more instructive or entertaining to do.
Others went equally far, through storm and mud, in wagons or on foot,
from a higher sense of personal responsibility and duty. With many it
was a most grave and serious business. The house was usually packed
to repletion. Professional ambulatory revivalists, often from remoter
parts of the state or county, would stop there on their religious crusades
through the land, to attend and help at these meetings. Many of these
were specially gifted in the kind of praying and speaking that was usually
most successful at such times. It is not overdrawing to say that many
times on a still night the noise of those meetings was heard a mile away
from the church. In one occasion I saw a leading exhorter at one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
those meetings enter the pulpit, take off his coat, hurl it into a corner,
and standing in his shirt sleeves begin a wild and excited harangue. After
possibly half an hour of most violent imprecations and raving he came
down from the pulpit, jumped up on top of the rail which extended down
the center of the room and divided the seats on the two sides of the house,
and from there finished, and exhausted himself, begging and pleading
with sinners to come forward and be converted, and invoking “hell fire”
and all the torments supposed to accompany this kind of caloric, upon
those who dared to smile or exhibit a sentiment or action not in accord
with his.</p>

<p>The principal argument at those meetings was something to excite
fear through most terrible picturings of hell, and the length of an eternal
damnation and death. Scores would be converted, and many would
backslide before the probationary season had ended. Some were annually
re-converted, and as often returned again to their natural state. Many
remained true to the new life, and became useful and prominent members
of the church and community. It cannot be successfully denied that
many were reached and reformed at those meetings whose consciences
never could have been touched by any milder form of preaching. They
had to be gathered in a whirlwind or not at all.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE SECOND ADVENT</p>

<p>This chapter cannot well be closed without some reference to
“Millerism” and the preaching of Millerite doctrines in the winter of
1842-43. It is doubtful if any other religious movement of modern
times, and certainly few in all historic time, have ever, in so short a
period, awakened so vast a religious excitement and terror as the announcement
and promulgation of these doctrines. Ten years before
Rev. William Miller, of Pittsfield, Mass., began preaching upon the subject
of the second coming of Christ, and claimed to have discovered some
key to the prophecies by which the near approach of the end of the world
and of the judgment day was clearly shown. His earnest manner and elaborate
arguments, apparently fortified with abundant historic proof, had
attracted great attention and started many followers to adopt and preach
the doctrines, so that, at the period named, the excitement attending it
throughout Christendom was at its highest point. The time for this
holocaust had been definitely fixed by these modern interpreters. The
year was 1843 and February was the month when all things were to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
collapse and end. Even the day was fixed by some. On that, however,
all did not agree. Some fixed the 14th and others the 16th of February,
and others still other days in that month for the happening of this terrible
event. When we recall that the doctrine found millions of believers in
the most civilized centers of the world, and for a time seriously paralyzed
business in London, New York and Philadelphia, we will not wonder that
with the people then living in the dreary solitudes of Dallas, such a
doctrine found ready listeners and willing believers almost everywhere.
The old log schoolhouse was not large enough to hold the meetings, and
others were started in different places. A very large one was conducted
at the “Goss” or “Corner” schoolhouse. The time was getting short,
and with the nearing of the fatal day excitement increased. Half the
people of the community were in some degree insane. Many people
refused to do any business, but devoted themselves entirely to religious
work and meditation. These meetings were started early in the fall,
and were kept up continuously through the winter. The plan and intention
of the leaders was to convert everyone in Dallas township, and with
a few exceptions the plan succeeded. Of course there were different
degrees of faith. Some were so sure of the dissolution of all things on
the appointed day that they refused to make any provisions for a longer
existence. One man, Christian Snyder, refused to sell corn or grain, but
was willing to give it away to the needy, and only desired to keep enough
for the needs of himself and family until the fixed final day. Many of
the people spent that dreadful winter reading the Bible, praying and
pondering over that horrible interpretation. The memorable meteoric
shower which extended almost over the whole world on the night of the
12th and 13th of November, 1833, was still fresh in the memory of almost
every adult, and was well calculated to prepare the mind to believe the
proofs and prophecies of such a catastrophe. That never-to-be-forgotten
rain of fire must have been frightfully impressive even to the most scientific
man who could best understand the causes which produced it. It has
no parallel in recorded history, and one can quite readily understand how
such an interpretation of the holy prophecies, following immediately such
a fiery manifestation in the heavens, should find easy believers.</p>

<p>Converts were frequently baptized that winter by immersion
through holes cut in the ice, and in one instance, I am credibly informed,
when a parent only succeeded in converting a doubting daughter on the
night before the supposed fatal day, he took her himself on that bitter
cold night to the nearest mill-pond, cut a hole in the ice and baptized her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
by immersion. The man was personally well known to me, and to the
day of his death, which occurred only within the last decade, he remained
firm in his faith in similar interpretations of the prophecies, and continued
calculating and fixing new dates in the future for the coming of the end
of all things. He was never disconcerted by any failures, but seriously
accounted for it by saying that he had made a little error in his calculation,
and gave you a new and corrected date further on. This man was
Christopher Snyder.</p>

<p>An anecdote is told of Harris in connection with the meteoric shower
above referred to, illustrating the common belief that the stars had
actually fallen from the heavens. On the evening following the shower,
Mr. Harris said he could see a great diminution of the number of stars in
the heavens, and ventured the belief that a few more showers like the
one of the evening before would use up the rest of them. So common
was this belief that the stars had actually fallen, so great and memorable
was the event, that to this day, among the older men about Dallas, you
will occasionally hear men trying to fix the date or year of some long past
occurrence, and not infrequently one will say something like this: “Well,
I know it happened then because the stars fell in thirty-three, and this
happened just so many years after” (or before, just as the case may be)—“now
figure it up yourself.”</p>


<p class="ph4">SOCIAL THINGS</p>

<p>Of “apple cuts” I can speak in lighter vein. They were generally
occasions of great merriment.</p>

<p>It has been truly said that a country is poor indeed when it is so
poor that dried apples become a luxury. Before the days of cheap sugar
and canned fruits, dried apples and cider apple sauce, the latter made of
apples boiled to a pulp in cider, were luxuries and necessities both in many
places besides ours. Apples were always abundant and cheap in Dallas.
In fact, when the forests are cleared away, apple trees are found to spring
up spontaneously in some places, and only need a little trimming and protection
to become good orchards. This fact was accounted for to the
writer by the owner of one such orchard as follows: He said a good
many people had marveled at the natural growth of his orchard, and had
asked him how he could account for it. “Of course you know,” said
he, “that it has always been my habit to give such things a good deal
of thought. I could never be satisfied, like most folks, to just sit down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
and take things as they come without trying to understand them, and
I always keep at them until I cipher them out. Now, you see it’s just
like this about these apple trees: Some day or ’nuther, probably millions
of years ago, this hull country was overflowed by the ocean. That’s
plain enough to any man who takes the trouble to think about these
things. Well, right about over here somewhere there has been a shipwreck
some day, and a ship load of apples has sunk right here, and these
apple trees have sprung from the seeds. You know a seed will keep a
great while and then grow.”</p>

<p>The work of paring the apples and removing the cores for an
ordinary family’s winter supply of dried apples and apple butter, before
the days of machines for that purpose, was a task of no little magnitude.
All had to be done by hand and as sometimes happened, many bushels had
to be so treated. It was a task that would have occupied the working
portion of an ordinary family several days, and thus much of the fruit
would, from long keeping, have lost its value for cider appliance by becoming
stale and partly dried. For this reason there seemed almost a
necessity for calling in help sufficient to do the required amount of work
in a very short period of time. The apple cut solved this difficulty successfully.
When a family had once determined on having an apple cut,
it was given out to the nearest neighbors, and from them it spread of its
own accord for miles around. Those who heard of it could go if they
chose to. No special invitations were required. The apple cut was an
evening festivity, and was most “prevalent” just after buckwheat thrashing,
when the nights were cool and the roads not very muddy. I am told
that in later years it began to be considered “bad form” to go to an apple
cut without special invitation; but apple cuts were degenerating then, and
they died soon after when the apple parer in its present improved form
was introduced.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned apple cut was a very informal affair. Each
guest upon arrival was expected to take a plate and knife, select a seat
and some apples, and begin work without disturbing anyone else. The
“cut” usually lasted for an hour or two. Twenty or thirty people could,
and did usually, accomplish a good deal in that time in the way of work
as well as say and do a great many of the commonplace things that country
people ordinarily indulge in when thus congenially thrown together.</p>

<p>After the work was finished and the <i>débris</i> cleared away, a surreptitious
fiddle was sometimes pulled from an old grain bag and started up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
“Fisher’s Hornpipe,” “Money Musk” and “The Arkansaw Traveler”
composed the stock of the average fiddler thereabouts in those days, and
any of them was enough to set all heels, with the slightest proclivities
in that way, to kicking in the French Four, Virginia Reel or Cotillion.
At some houses dancing was looked upon as improper, and in its stead
some simple games were played. The festivities usually broke off early,
as all had long distances to go. Dissipation in the matter of late hours
could not be indulged in very much, because of the very general country
habit of early rising.</p>

<p>The gentlemen did not often forget or fail to be gallant in the matter
of escorting the ladies home. Usually the demands of etiquette were
satisfied with the gentleman “going only as far as the chips,” as it was
commonly expressed, meaning, of course, the place where the wood was
hauled in front of the house and chopped up for firewood.</p>

<p>“Going as far as the chips” was an expression as common and as
generally understood in that day as going to the front gate would be now.
The front gate then was generally a few improvised steps to assist in
climbing over the rail fence at some point near the “chips” or wood pile.</p>

<p>“Spinning Bees” and “Quilting Bees” were exclusively feminine
industries. With each invitation to a “spinning bee” was sent a bunch
of tow sufficient for two or three days’ spinning, which the recipient was
expected to convert into thread or yarn by or before the date fixed for the
party. The acceptance of the tow was equivalent to a formal acceptance
of the invitation. On the appointed day each lady took her bunch of
spun tow and proceeded early in the afternoon to the house of the hostess.
The afternoon was usually spent in the usually easy and unconventional
manner that might be expected when a dozen or fifteen able-bodied women
of the neighborhood, who had not seen each other lately, are assembled.
This was, of course, long before the newspaper or magazine had reached
their present perfection, and before the daily paper “brought the universe
to our breakfast table.”</p>

<p>The surest way for a lady to avoid being the subject of comment
was to be at the meeting. The gentlemen always came in time for tea
and to see the ladies home.</p>

<p>“Quilting Bees” define themselves in their name. They were very
similar to spinning bees, except that the work was done after the guests
had assembled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>Of “Stoning Bees,” “Logging Bees” and “Raising Bees,” description
is unnecessary. The names are almost self-explaining, though
just why they were called “Bees” I cannot learn, unless it is because those
who came were expected to, and usually did, imitate the industrial virtues
of that insect. They were also sometimes called “frolics,” possibly for
the reason that the frolicking was often as hard and as general as the
work. Strong and hearty men were much inclined to playful trials of
strength and other frivolities when they met at such times. This tendency
was much enhanced in the earlier days by the customary presence of
intoxicants.</p>

<p>These amusements were varied and extended far beyond those above
mentioned. They exhibited and illustrate much of the character, surroundings
and habits of those early people. They wanted no better
amusement. It was, in their esteem, a wicked waste of time and in conflict
with their necessary economies to have parties or gatherings of any
kind exclusively for amusement, and unaccompanied with some economic
or industrial purpose like those indicated above.</p>

<p>The dancing party or ball was a thing of later date, but even when
it came, and for many years after, it was looked upon by the more serious
people as not only wicked and degrading in a religious and moral point of
view, but very wasteful in an economic sense.</p>

<p>Their hard sense taught them that their industrio-social gatherings,
together with the church meetings and Sunday-schools, furnished ample
occasions for the young to meet and become acquainted, while the elements
of evil that crept into modern society elsewhere were there reduced
to a minimum.</p>


<p class="ph4">A THRIFTY STOREKEEPER</p>

<p>A good story is told of Joseph Hoover dating well back in the first
half of the century. He went one day to the store of Mr. Jacob R——,
in a neighboring town, to get a gallon of molasses, taking with him the
jug usually used for that purpose. As it happened that day, the son,
Isaac, who usually waited on him, was otherwise engaged, and the father,
Jacob, went down cellar to draw the molasses. After being gone some
time, Jacob called up from the cellar to Joseph and said that the jug did
not hold a gallon. “Call Isaac,” replied Hoover, “and let him try; he
has always been able to get a gallon in that jug!”</p>

<p class="ph3">III</p>

<p class="ph4">HALLECK AND POPE</p>

<p>The fourth letter<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> contains a sentence which almost takes one’s
breath. It is bunglingly constructed—a thing unusual in Pope’s
communications. He had received a letter from Halleck, dated
November 7, intimating that the Secretary of War would order a court of
inquiry, and he answers, conveying the following:</p>

<p>“The overt act at Alexandria, during the engagement near Centreville,
can be fully substantiated by letters from many officers since I have
been here [St. Paul], it is quite certain [Now mark!] <i>that my defeat was
predetermined</i>, [Now mark again!] and I think you must now be conscious
of it.”</p>

<p>Pope does not even intimate who predetermined that “overt act,”
although he intimates rather clearly that Halleck is conscious of the facts.
It is difficult to see, however, how either McClellan, Porter or Griffin
could “predetermine” either a victory or a defeat at that time.</p>

<p>On the 25th day of November, 1862, the very day set by General
Pope, Major-General Halleck ordered a general court-martial for the
trial of Major-General Fitz-John Porter, and on that same day he made
his official report of the battle in which he certified to Pope’s efficiency, as
the latter had demanded in those uncanny letters. And on the 5th day
of December, Major-General Pope declared under oath:</p>

<p>“This is all I have yet done”: <i>i. e.</i>, “in my official reports of the
operations of the army, to set forth all the facts as they transpired on the
field. I have not preferred charges against him. I have merely set
forth facts in my official reports,” etc.</p>

<p>The “Official Records” referred to show that he “set forth” certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
facts [or fancies] in his private letters to Halleck, which, by some mysterious
influence have found their way into print, and suggest that an explanation
is in order to reconcile his sworn testimony with the fact that he
was urging General Halleck to action, by military court, and even threatening
him in case he should neglect such action.</p>

<p>He says: “No man knows better than yourself the constancy, the
energy, and the zeal with which I endeavored to carry out your programme
in Virginia. Your own letters and dispatches, from beginning
to end, are sufficient evidence of this fact, and also of the fact that I not
only committed no mistake, but that every act and movement met with
your heartiest concurrence.”</p>

<p>[<i>Note.</i>—This statement is fully corroborated by the “Official Records.”
It is as certain as anything can be that Halleck formulated the
plan and that Pope executed it. If he appeared to be making mistakes,
he was obeying orders, and Halleck should be chargeable.]</p>

<p>Pope continues: “Your own declarations to me up to the last hour
I remained in Washington bore testimony that I had shown every quality
to command success.”...</p>

<p>“Having, at your own urgent request [Mark that well! and what follows
also. This paragraph shows that Halleck himself was the instigator
of the charges against Porter], and from a sense of duty [!] laid
before the Government, the conduct of McClellan, Porter and Griffin,
and substantiated the facts stated by their own written documents, I am
not disposed to push the matter further, unless the silence of the Government
[this means Halleck, as has been shown Halleck was the only objector
to the gratification of Pope’s wishes], in the midst of the unscrupulous
slander and misrepresentation purposely put in circulation against me
and the restoration of these officers, without trial, to their commands,
coupled with my banishment to a distant and unimportant department,
render it necessary as an act of justice to myself.”</p>

<p>How keenly Pope feels his disgrace, having been used as a tool and
then flung aside, is shown clearly. He continues:</p>

<p>“As I have already said, I challenge and seek examination of my
campaign in Virginia in all its details, and unless the Government by some
high mark of public confidence, such as they have given to me in private,
relieves me from the atrocious injury done to my character as a soldier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
... justice to myself and to all connected with me demands that I
should urge the court of inquiry.... This investigation, under the
circumstances above stated, I shall assuredly urge in every way. If it
cannot be accomplished by military courts, it will undoubtedly be the
subject of the inquiry in Congress.”</p>

<p>Then follows a darkly ominous hint: “It is especially hard, in view
of my relations with you [Note that!] that I should be compelled even to
ask at your hands the justice which it is your duty to assure to every
officer of the army.... I tell you frankly that by the time Congress
meets such influences as can not be resisted will be brought to bear on
this subject.... I prefer greatly that you should do me this justice
of your own accord.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Altogether this letter is a rare specimen of the chiaroscuro in the art
epistolary; it tells of Halleck’s acts of injustice which Pope will right by
every means in his power. At times it breathes hatred and vengeance,
and closes with such a loving assurance as this:</p>

<p>“I write you this letter with mixed feelings. Personal friendship
and interest in your welfare, I think, predominate. I am not so blinded
as not to know that it gave you pain to allow such scandal against me
and to take such action as you thought the peculiar circumstances required.
Much as I differ with you on the subject, I am not ready to blame you or
to feel bitterly.”</p>

<p>Then follows that warning: “I impress upon you the necessity for
your own sake of considering carefully the suggestions I have presented,”
and closes with the assurance, “I shall not again address you a letter on
such a subject.”</p>

<p>This assurance was not fulfilled. Indeed, Pope wrote several letters
on the subject, as will appear. Queer letters were they, to be written by a
major-general commanding a department, to his superior, the general-in-chief,
to whom he administers the medicine <i>à la cheval de trait</i>.</p>

<p>To summarize: Pope makes these charges against Halleck.</p>

<p>(1) That the plan of campaign was Halleck’s.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>(2) That Pope was but an instrument in the hands of the general-in-chief.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>(3) That Pope faithfully executed Halleck’s plans.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>(4) That the latter fully approved every act of the former, thereby
making himself responsible, so far as Pope was concerned, for the final
result.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Here a pause. These charges are fully substantiated by letters and
telegrams passing between Halleck and Pope, which appear in parts II
and III, of Vol. XII, of the Official Records. Pope was regularly advising
Halleck of his movements, and Halleck was as regularly approving
the same. And as late as August 26, 11:45 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, Halleck wired Pope:
“Not the slightest dissatisfaction has been felt in regard to your operations
on the Rappahannock,” etc.</p>

<p>Returning to the charges:</p>

<p>(5) That Pope had made the charges against Generals McClellan,
Porter and Griffin “at Halleck’s own urgent request.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Halleck was
the real instigator.</p>

<p>(6) That Halleck had not assigned him [Pope] to command of
the western department, which, as Pope says, “would at once have freed
me [Pope] from the odium and abuse which have so shamefully and
unjustly been heaped upon me by the papers and people,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>(7) That he found himself banished to the frontier.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>(8) That his character and reputation as a soldier had been deeply
and irretrievably injured.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>(9) That the Government refused to allow him to publish the
facts<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and</p>

<p>(10) That General-in-Chief Halleck declined to acknowledge his
services publicly.</p>

<p>All through the letters are insinuations and charges against McClellan,
Porter and Griffin. And he makes categorical demand in these
words:</p>

<p>“I said, and say now, that one of three things I was entitled to; any
one of them would have satisfied me. The dictates of the commonest
justice gave me the right to expect one of them at least:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>1st. That the court of inquiry be at once held and the blame be fixed
where it belongs. It is now too late for that, as the delay has already
made the worst impression against me that is possible.</p>

<p>2d. That the Government should acknowledge publicly, as it had
done privately, my services in Virginia, or</p>

<p>3d. That in case neither of these things could be done, then that the
Government bestow upon me some mark of public confidence, as its opinion
of my ability warranted.</p>

<p>None of these things have been done,” etc.</p>

<p>He continues: “You know me well enough I think, to understand
that I will never submit if I can help it. The court of inquiry, which you
inform me has been ordered, will amount to nothing for several reasons.
It is too late, so far as I am concerned. Its proceedings, I presume, will
be secret, as in Harper’s Ferry business. The principal witnesses are
here with me, and I myself should be present. The Mississippi River
closes by the 25th of November [Note that date!]; frequently sooner
than that. It is then next to impossible to get away from this place. A
journey through the snow of 200 miles is required to communicate with
any railroad.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>And on the very day which Pope had named, November 25, 1862,
General-in-Chief Halleck issued his order for the court-martial of Fitz-John
Porter, and issued his report certifying to the efficiency of General
Pope, thus avoiding the court of inquiry which Pope had threatened to
demand.</p>

<p>Such a court, if honestly conducted, would have laid bare the truth,
and shown to the world that Halleck himself had prevented the reinforcements
from reaching Pope, caused the defeat of Second Bull Run, imperiled
the national capital, and opened the door of Maryland to Jefferson
Davis and Robert E. Lee.</p>

<p>This conclusion is supported both by Halleck’s official report and by
his testimony before the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. In
the former, he says: “Had the Army of the Potomac arrived a few days
earlier, the rebel army could have been easily defeated and, perhaps,
destroyed.” His testimony before that committee, on March 11,
1863.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“Question. To what do you attribute the disastrous result of General
Pope’s campaign?</p>

<p>Answer. I think our troops were not sufficiently concentrated so
as to be all brought into action on the field of battle; and there was great
delay in getting reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac to General
Pope’s assistance.</p>

<p>Question. To what is that delay attributable?</p>

<p>Answer. Partly, I think, to accidents, and partly to a want of
energy in the troops, or their officers, in getting forward to General Pope’s
assistance. I could not say that that was due to any particular individual.
It may have resulted from the officers generally not feeling the absolute
necessity of great haste in re-enforcing General Pope. The troops, after
they started from the Peninsula, were considerably delayed by heavy
storms that came on at that time.”</p>

<p>[<i>Note.</i>—General Halleck has not told that committee, what his own
letters and telegrams conclusively prove, that the principal delay of those
reinforcements was due to his own wilfully false telegrams to Generals
McClellan, Burnside, and Porter, and that he also prevented General
Franklin and the Sixth Army Corps from reaching Pope from Alexandria
by refusing to provide transportation. The next question and answer
fixes the blame directly upon Halleck himself]:</p>

<p>“Question. Had the Army of the Peninsula [<i>i. e.</i>, the army under
McClellan, which embraced both Porter’s and Franklin’s corps] been
brought to co-operate with the Army of Virginia [under the command of
Pope] with the utmost energy that circumstances would have permitted,
in your judgment as a military man, would it not have resulted in our
victory instead of our defeat?</p>

<p>Answer. I thought so at the time, and still think so.”</p>

<p>And this is the opinion of all military critics who have pronounced
judgment in the case. It is also certainly true that Halleck’s own orders
and telegrams prove that he himself, and apparently purposely, prevented
such co-operation, and it throws a peculiar significance on Pope’s charge
in his letter to Halleck, dated November 20, 1862, before quoted, “<i>It is
quite certain that my defeat was predetermined, and I think you must now
be conscious of it</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>
<p>The consequences which followed the defeat of Pope were not immediately
and fully appreciated at the time in the North, on account of the
censorship of the press, nor do they seem to be so at this day. Orders
were given to prepare for the evacuation of Washington; vessels were
ordered to the arsenal to receive the munitions of war for shipment northward;
one warship was anchored in the Potomac, ready to receive the
President, the Cabinet and the more important archives of the Government:
Secretary Stanton advised Mr. Hiram Barney, then Collector of the
Port of New York, to leave Washington at once, as communication might
be cut off before morning;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Stanton and Halleck assured President Lincoln
that the Capital was lost.</p>

<p>Singularly enough the designs against Washington in the East were
at the same time and in the same manner being duplicated against Cincinnati,
then the “Queen City of the West.”</p>

<p>On August 30, while Pope was fighting the second Bull Run battle
in Virginia, the Confederate Major-General, E. Kirby Smith, was fighting
the battle of Richmond, Ky. In his report to General Braxton Bragg,
Smith says:</p>

<p>“The enemy’s loss during the day is about 1400 killed and wounded,
and 4000 prisoners. Our loss is about 500 killed and wounded. General
Miller was killed, General Nelson wounded, and General Manson
taken prisoner. The remnant of the Federal force in Kentucky is making
its way, utterly demoralized and scattered, to the Ohio. General
Marshall is in communication with me. Our column is moving upon
Cincinnati.”</p>

<p>On September 2, Lexington was occupied by Kirby Smith’s infantry.
He reports to General Cooper that the Union killed and wounded
exceed 1000; “the prisoners amount to between 5000 and 6000; the
loss—besides some twenty pieces of artillery, including that taken here
(Lexington) and at Frankfort—9000 small arms and large quantities
of supplies.” The Confederate cavalry, he reports, pursued the Union
forces to within twelve miles of Louisville; and, he adds: “I have sent
a small force to Frankfort, to take possession of the arsenal and public
property there. I am pushing some forces in the direction of Cincinnati,
in order to give the people of Kentucky time to organize. General Heth,
with the advance, is at Cynthiana, with orders to threaten Covington.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>
<p>This invasion of Kentucky was due to Halleck, as was proved before
the military court appointed “to inquire into and report upon the operations
of the forces under command of Major-General Buell in the States
of Tennessee and Kentucky, and particularly in reference to General
Buell suffering the State of Kentucky to be invaded by the rebel forces
under General Bragg,” etc.</p>

<p>That court was in session from November 27, 1862, until May 6,
1863, with the gallant Major-General Lew Wallace presiding. Its
opinion recited that Halleck had ordered General Buell to march against
Chattanooga and take it, with the ulterior object of dislodging Kirby
Smith and his rebel force from East Tennessee; that General Buell had
force sufficient to accomplish the object if he could have marched promptly
to Chattanooga; that the plan of operation prescribed by General Halleck
compelled General Buell to repair the Memphis and Charleston railroad
from Corinth to Decatur, and put it in running order; that the road
proved of comparatively little service; that the work forced such delays
that a prompt march upon Chattanooga was impossible, while they made
the rebel invasion of Tennessee and Kentucky possible. Our forces were
driven northward to the Ohio, leaving the Memphis and Charleston
railroad in excellent condition for the use of the Confederates.
Strangely enough, Halleck’s orders to Buell had inured to the benefit of
the Confederates in the West, in the same manner and along the same
lines as his orders to McClellan and to Pope had inured to the benefit
of the Confederates in the East.</p>

<p>Both Washington and Cincinnati were imperiled at the same time,
and by the same officer, General-in-Chief Halleck, and in the same way—by
a succession of steps that appear to have been carefully planned.</p>

<p>Now, mark what follows.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1872, the House of Representatives called upon the
Secretary of War for a copy of the proceedings of that military court;
and on April 13 the Secretary reported to the House, “that a careful and
exhaustive search among all the records and files in this Department fails
to discover what disposition was made of the proceedings of the Commission,”
etc.</p>

<p>But though the records of those proceedings which fix the blame
for that campaign upon Major-General Halleck were lost or stolen from
the archives of the War Department, Benn Pitman, the phonographic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
reporter of the court, had possession of a report of those proceedings.
And, by Act of Congress, approved by President Grant on June 5, 1872,
the Secretary of War was “directed to employ at once Benn Pitman to
make a full and complete transcript of the phonographic notes taken by
him during the said investigation, and to put the same on file among the
records of the War Department, and to furnish a copy of the same to
Congress.”</p>

<p>The report of those proceedings may now be found in “Official Records,”
Series I, Vol. XVI, Part I, pp. 6 to 726, inclusive. The most
melancholy part of the story lies in the fact that Porter, who certainly
helped to save Washington from falling into Lee’s hands, had his life
blasted by Halleck, and died without knowledge that Halleck, not Pope,
was really guilty of the disaster which so nearly resulted in the abandonment
of the Capital to the Confederates, and while Halleck was directing
affairs in the West in such a manner as to imperil Cincinnati.</p>

<p>The remarkable co-operation between Pope and Buell for the surrender
of those cities, and which was attempted by Halleck, does not look
like a concatenation of accidental circumstances. This is accentuated by
the charge against Halleck’s loyalty to the Republic which was made by
the gallant Wallace after he had presided over that Buell military court.
He was a careful man; and, being a good lawyer, he understood the laws
and effect of evidence. Porter, who prevented the surrender of Washington,
and Buell, who saved Cincinnati, were both punished. It looks
as if they had interfered with Halleck’s plan of a general surrender.</p>


<p class="ph4">L’ENVOI</p>

<p>In January, 1899, the writer commenced to unravel the mystery surrounding
the battle of Harper’s Ferry, which culminated in the surrender
of that post September 15, 1862. He was a member of that garrison,
and he knew that history had not truthfully recorded the defense, some
chronicles reading that “Harper’s Ferry fell without a struggle,” others
that “there was no defense”; in the main, historians were a unit.</p>

<p>Such reports are wholly false. The defense of that post was stubborn
and prolonged, lasting from September 11, when the Confederates
showed themselves in Pleasant Valley, until the 15th, when the garrison
was subjected to one of the fiercest bombardments of the Civil War.
Never was hope abandoned until the last shell was expended, though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
little garrison of 12,500 men was besieged by what was practically the
whole of Lee’s army. Starting on a new line of research, and abandoning
the path beaten by others, he found many battles lost in the same manner,
and the responsibility shifted from the shoulders of the guilty and carefully
loaded upon those of the innocent, and all by the use of the same
means, a false report by General-in-Chief Halleck, and a bogus trial by
a military court.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among these was the battle of Second Bull Run, followed
by the trial of Fitz-John Porter. That battle was certainly lost by
Halleck, as shown by documents over that general’s own signature. And
Pope knew it, and charged that it was premeditated. To avoid the odium
which some papers were attaching to his name, the latter applied the whip
and spur to the former, who, under threat of exposure, ordered the court-martial
of the innocent and gallant Major-General Fitz-John Porter.
The battle of Harper’s Ferry followed; the result was the same; lost by
Halleck; responsibility lifted from his shoulders, and carefully divided
between General McClellan (for not relieving the post) and Colonel
Dixon S. Mills (for not defending it). After that came Fredericksburg,
with similar results; lost by Halleck; responsibility lifted from his
shoulders, and divided between Burnside and Franklin.</p>

<p>Study the plans adopted in one instance; the plans adopted in the
others become manifest. The losing of the battles to the Union arms was
accomplished by carefully prepared plans, and reduced to an exact science.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NORTHERN_NECK_OF_VIRGINIA">THE NORTHERN NECK OF VIRGINIA</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4">PRESENT-DAY ASPECTS OF WASHINGTON’S BIRTHPLACE</p>


<p>Five Virginia counties lying between the Potomac and the Rappahannock
constitute the Northern Neck, the region in which George
Washington, Light Horse Harry Lee, and his more famous son
were born and bred. There are a scant thousand square miles in these
counties of King George, Westmoreland, Richmond, Northumberland,
and Lancaster, and the population of the five is under fifty-five thousand.
At no point are the rivers much more than thirty miles apart, and near the
northern boundary line of King George the harbors on the two streams
are only nine miles apart. Washington was born on a lonely plantation
in Westmoreland County, bordering the beautiful Bridges Creek, within
sight of the Potomac. At Colonial Beach, two or three miles across the
mouth of Monroe Creek, also in Westmoreland County, stands a house in
good repair, which is declared to have been the residence of Light Horse
Harry Lee before he removed to Fairfax County. Washington as an
infant was taken by his parents to their new home opposite Fredericksburg,
in Stafford County, and at the age of twenty he inherited from his
half-brother Lawrence the fine estate of Mount Vernon, in Fairfax
County. Lawrence had named his estate in honor of Admiral Vernon,
with whom the young Virginian had served as an officer in the campaign
against the Spanish-American stronghold of Cartagena. It was Lawrence’s
acquaintance with Admiral Vernon that won for George Washington
the offer of a midshipman’s commission in the royal navy, an
appointment that only his mother’s strong objection prevented him from
accepting.</p>

<p>From the birthplace of Washington to his second home opposite
Fredericksburg is hardly more than fifty-five miles as the crow flies, and
from the birthplace to the scene of his death at Mount Vernon is under
seventy miles. The triangle enclosed by the lines connecting these points
includes a tract of Virginia that is full of historic interest, and singularly
rich and beautiful as an agricultural region. Most of the counties of the
Northern Neck are increasing in population, but they lie far from railways,
and their mode of communication with the outside world is the
steamboats that ply from Baltimore up and down the two rivers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>In spite, therefore, of the rolling years, and of civil war, and emancipation,
the Northern Neck of Virginia is in many respects much what it
was when George Washington and Light Horse Harry Lee were born a
month apart in the quaint and lovely old Westmoreland of the year 1732.
The visitor to Mount Vernon comes away with a strong impression of
Washington, the local magnate and world-wide hero. But Mount Vernon,
in spite of its tomb and its relics, many of them actually used and
handled by Washington himself, can hardly give one the eighteenth century
atmosphere. To obtain that one must make a pilgrimage to the
region of Washington’s birth. A fair shaft erected by the Federal Government
now stands on the spot occupied by the homestead of Augustine
Washington, the birthplace of his mighty son. The spot is as remote and
lonely as it was when Washington’s eyes first saw the light, and the aspect
of the region must be much what it was in that day. Doubtless the woodland
has shrunk in area and the plowed land has widened. But there,
in full view from the monument, are the land-locked tidal waters of the
little stream, and eastward lies the broad lazy flood of the Potomac, idly
moving beneath the soft overarching sky. Everywhere are the marks of
an old civilization. The road that leads from the wharf at Wakefield on
Monroe Creek to the monument is lined with cherry trees escaped from
the old orchards of the neighborhood. The mockingbird sings in all the
woodlands as it must have sung in the ears of Augustine Washington as
he moved about his fields, and gray old log granaries of the eighteenth
century pattern still stand amid piles of last year’s corncobs. Even to-day
brand-new corn cribs are built in the same fashion of partly hewn logs.
The crops are also those of the earlier century. The monument itself
stands in the midst of a waving wheat field, and acres of Indian corn rustle
green and rich as they must have rustled in the first hot summer of George
Washington’s infancy.</p>

<p>The reality of it all is increased by the bodily presence of Washington’s
own kin, men and women bearing his name, the descendants of his
collateral relatives. A little boat rocking at anchor off the wharf at
Wakefield is the fishing dory of Lawrence Washington, commonly called
“Lal” Washington by his neighbors. He is a man of substance and
dignity. But he takes delight in fishing his own pound nets, and the
unpretentious fishermen of the region tell how the old man’s enthusiasm
was such that he rushed waist deep into the water to help three or four
young fellows drag ashore a heavily laden seine. His brother was for
years State’s Attorney of a neighboring county, and other members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
family are landholders in Westmoreland. Their neighbors accept these
families of historic name in a simple, matter-of-fact fashion, and with no
humiliating sense of inferiority. “They’re all smart people,” said the
young fisherman that sailed us across Monroe Creek to the wharf at Wakefield,
and that is what Westmoreland expects of the Washingtons.</p>

<p>Neighboring plantations are stocked with fine old European nut and
fruit trees, such as the colonists with the increasing wealth of the third
and fourth generations were accustomed to import. In some places the
fig is cultivated, and within the shadow of the birthplace monument is a
dense colony of young fig shoots which have sprung and resprung after
every severe winter for perhaps more than a century and a half. The
steep bank of Bridges Creek to the southeast of the monument is lined
with cherry trees that to this day bear excellent fruit, to be had merely for
the picking. One gathers from all the surroundings of the place a strong
sense of the dignity and simplicity that mark plantation life in Virginia.</p>

<p>It is a quiet life, indeed, that the people of these Westmoreland
plantations lead. Even to this day sailing craft slowly worm their way
far into the deep navigable inlets of the region, and carry freight to Baltimore
and Washington. Each plantation has its own wharf, and each
planter keeps a lookout for the coming schooner, just as their ancestors of
Washington’s day must have watched for the slow and patient craft that
plied up and down the Potomac, and away to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and
New York, or across the Atlantic to England, a voyage that might stretch
out for six or eight, ten, or even twelve weeks.</p>

<p>The very speech of the people has a slightly archaic flavor, and
family names are redolent of old English ancestry. Here still are the
Kendalls, who like to boast that one of their ancestors was the earliest mail
contractor in Virginia. The elder Kendall, a man of substance and fair
education, found satisfactory reasons for selling all that he had and coming
to Jamestown with Captain John Smith. In coming away he left
behind a son just grown to manhood and some debts owing to the estate.
The son was instructed to collect what he could of the proceeds, invest it
in blankets and trinkets such as the Indians liked, and to follow the father
to Jamestown. The young man obeyed the paternal instructions, but in
sailing up the Potomac with his freight of gewgaws he mistook the Potomac
for the James. After vainly looking for Jamestown, he concluded
that the settlement had been destroyed by the Indians, and, having reached
the present site of Alexandria, he made a settlement and called it Bell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
Haven. Some months later an Indian who visited Bell Haven made the
settlers to understand that there were white men on a river further south.
Young Kendall knew then that Jamestown was still in being. So he wrote
a letter to his father and entrusted it to the Indian to be delivered at
Jamestown, paying him for the service one gay woolen blanket. Father
and son thus came into communication, but the son remained at Bell
Haven, and from him are descended the Kendalls of the Northern Neck.</p>

<p>The whole region teems with traditions of Washington. Down in
Northumberland County, the lovely little harbor of Lodge is named from
the fact that here stood the Masonic lodge that Washington used to attend.
The British destroyed the house during the Revolutionary War,
but the cornerstone was found and opened not many years ago, and some
of its treasures of old English money were placed in the cornerstone
of the Masonic lodge at Kinsale, another charming little Virginia harbor.
It is at Lodge that the maker of canceling dies for the Post Office Department,
exiled from Washington because of the climate, has for nearly
twenty years carried on his business with the aid of country youths trained
for the purpose.</p>

<p>If the shore is much what it was in Washington’s infancy,
the river and its tributaries are even more so. Those who know
the Potomac at Washington or amid the mountains that hem it in further
west and north, may well have no suspicion of the vast flood which it becomes
in the lower part of its course. Fifty miles below Washington the
river is from four to six miles wide. Sixty miles below the capital it has
spread to a width of ten miles, and in the lower forty miles of its course
it is from ten to eighteen miles wide, a great estuary of the Chesapeake,
with tributaries, almost nameless on the map, that fairly dwarf the Hudson.
The busy steamers plying these waters to carry the produce of the
plantations to the markets of Baltimore and Washington leave the Potomac
from time to time to lose themselves in its tortuous tributaries. Cape
on cape recedes to unfold new and unexpected depths of loveliness; little
harbors sit low on the tidal waters backed by wooded bluffs, behind which
lie the rich plantations of Northumberland and Westmoreland. A soft-spoken
race of easy-going Virginians haunts the landing-places. Fishermen,
still pursuing the traditional methods of the eighteenth century, fetch
in sea trout and striped bass and pike to sell them at absurdly low prices,
and for nine months of the year oystermen are busy. Every planter who
will can maintain his pound net in the shallows of the Potomac or one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
its tributaries, and all along the lower course of the stream the planter
may secure his own oysters almost without leaving the shore. The dainties
that filled colonial larders in Washington’s youth are still the food of
the region—oysters and clams, soft-shell crabs, wild duck, geese, and
swan in winter, and a bewildering variety of fish.</p>

<p>Just across the Potomac from Washington’s birthplace is old Catholic
Maryland of the Calvert Palatinate, settled almost exactly a century before
his birth, and still rich in the names and traditions of that earlier
time. The great width of the separating flood makes one shore invisible
from the other, and the only means of communication are either the local
sailing craft or the steamers that weave from side to side of the river and
lengthen the voyage from Baltimore to Washington to a matter of thirty
hours. Communication between Maryland and Virginia was almost as
easy in Washington’s day, for the steamboats have an annoying habit of
neglecting many miles of one shore or the other, and there are days when
no steamer crosses the stream. A man living in one of the little harbors
of the Northern Neck, being in a hurry to travel northward, found his
most expeditious mode of travel to be a drive of seventy miles to a railway
at Richmond. Shut in thus, the people of the Northern Neck have nursed
their traditions and held hard by their old family names, so that the visiting
stranger, if he have any touch of historic instinct, finds himself
singularly moved with a sense of his nearness in time to George Washington
and his contemporaries. The telephone, indeed, has brought these
people into tenuous communication with the modern world, but he that
looks out upon the sea-like flood of the Potomac from the mouth of one
of its many navigable tributaries in the Northern Neck can hardly persuade
himself that the capital of 80,000,000 people lies less than a hundred
miles up stream. Washington the man seems vastly more real and present
than Washington the city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FIGHT_AT_DIAMOND_ISLAND">THE FIGHT AT DIAMOND ISLAND</h2>
</div>


<p>Standing upon one of the heights near the head or southern end
of Lake George, the tourist looks down on the placid waters, and
sees at his feet a little island covered with verdure, and glowing
like an emerald in the summer sheen. This is Diamond Island,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> one of
the best known of the many exquisite isles that gem the little inland sea.</p>

<p>From time immemorial it has borne its present name, derived from
the exquisite crystals with which the underlying rock abounds. Here is
the scene of the fight which took place on this lake, September 24, 1777,
an occurrence that appears to have been purposely overlooked by the
Americans at the time, and which has since failed to find a chronicler.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But before proceeding to give the narrative of this event it may be
well to speak of several other points, and to make a brief statement of
the military situation at that time.</p>

<p>First comes the question of the discovery of Lake George by the
Europeans. According to the best knowledge that we possess, its waters
were first seen by a white man in the year 1646.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is true Champlain
tells us that he saw the falls at the outlet of the lake in 1609, yet there is
nothing whatever to indicate that he visited the lake itself, though the
Indians had informed him of its existence. It is reasonable, therefore, to
conclude that Lake George was seen for the first time by a European, May
29, 1646,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> when it received its name, “Lake Saint Sacrament,” from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
Rev. Isaac Jogues, S.J., who, in company with Jean Bourdon, the celebrated
engineer, was on his way south to effect a treaty with the Mohawks.
Arriving at the outlet of the lake on the evening of <i>Corpus Christi</i>, they
gave it the above name in honor of this festival, which falls on the Thursday
following Trinity Sunday, and commemorates the alleged Real
Presence of Christ in the Great Sacrament.</p>

<p>From this time until 1755 the lake was rarely visited by Europeans.
At this period the French commenced the fortifications of Ticonderoga,
while the English met the advance by the construction of Fort William
Henry at the opposite end of the lake.</p>

<p>We pass over the struggles that took place on these waters during
the French wars, and come to the period of the Revolution, when a feeble
English garrison held possession of Ticonderoga, while Captain Nordberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
lived in a little cottage at the head of the lake, being the nominal
commander of empty Fort George. With the commencement of the
struggle for liberty, Lake George resumed its former importance as a part
of the main highway to the Canadas, and by this route our troops went
northward, until the tide turned, and our own soil, in the summer of 1777,
became the scene of fresh invasion. Then Burgoyne’s troops poured in
like a flood, and for a time swept all before them. It was at this period
that the fight at Diamond Island took place.</p>

<p>Burgoyne had pushed with his troops, by the Whitehall route, far
to the southward of Lake George, being determined to strike at Albany,
having left but a small force at Ticonderoga, a handful of men at Fort
George, and a garrison at Diamond Island to guard the stores accumulated
there. Seeing the opportunity thus broadly presented, General Lincoln,
acting under the direction of Gates, resolved to make an effort to destroy
Burgoyne’s line of communication, and, if possible, capture his supplies.
To this end, he despatched Colonel John Brown with a force to attack
Ticonderoga, an enterprise which, though attended with partial success,
failed in the end. To this failure he subsequently added another, which
resulted from the fight at Diamond Island.</p>

<p>But since the printed accounts of the attack upon Ticonderoga are
almost as meagre as those of the struggle at the island, we will here give
the official report, which is likewise to be found among the Gates Papers,
now in the possession of the Historical Society of New York, prefacing
the report, however, with the English statement of Burgoyne.</p>

<p>In the course of a vindication of his military policy, General Burgoyne

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“During the events stated above, an attempt was made against Ticonderoga by
an army assembled under Major-General Lincoln, who found means to march with
a considerable corps from Huberton undiscovered, while another column of his force
passed the mountains Skenesborough and Lake George, and on the morning of the
18th of September a sudden and general attack was made upon the carrying place at
Lake-George, Sugar-Hill, Ticonderoga, and Mount-Independence. The sea officers
commanding the armed sloop stationed to defend the carrying place, as also some of
the officers commanding at the post of Sugar-Hill and at the Portage, were surprised,
and a considerable part of four companies of the 53d regiment were made prisoners;
a block-house, commanded by Lieutenant Lord of the 53d, was the only post on that
side that had time to make use of their arms, and they made a brave defence till
cannon taken from the surprised vessel was brought against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>After stating and lamenting so fatal a want of vigilance, I have to inform
your Lordship of the satisfactory events which followed.</p>

<p>The enemy having twice summoned Brigadier General Powell, and received
such answer as became a gallant officer entrusted with so important a post, and having
tried during the course of four days several attacks, and being repulsed in all,
retreated without having done any considerable damage.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Powell, from whose report to me I extract this relation,
gives great commendations to the regiment of Prince Frederick, and the other troops
stationed at Mount-Independence. The Brigadier also mentions with great applause
the behaviour of Captain Taylor of the 21st regiment, who was accidentally there on
his route to the army from the hospital, and Lieutenant Beecroft of the 24th regiment,
who with the artificers in arms defended an important battery.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Such is Burgoyne’s account of the attack upon Ticonderoga; next to
which comes that of Colonel Brown, who for the second time in the
course of his military experience has an opportunity of exhibiting his unquestioned
valor. His report to General Lincoln runs as follows:</p>

<p>With great fatigue after marching all last night I arrived at this place at the
break of day, and after the best disposition of the men, I could make, immediately
began the attack, and in a few minutes, carried the place. I then without any loss

of the enemy were posted, who also were soon made prisoners, a small number of
whom having taken possession of a block house in that Vicinity were with more
difficulty bro’t to submission; but at the sight of a Cannon they surrendered. during
this season of success, Mount Defiance also fell into our hands. I have taken possession
of the old french lines at Ticonderoga, and have sent a flag demanding the
surrender of Ty: and mount independence in strong and peremptory terms. I have
had as yet no information of the event of Col<sup>o</sup>. Johnson’s attack on the mount. My

<p>We now turn to the fight at Diamond Island, giving first the English
version, simply remarking as a preliminary, that in the postscript of a
letter addressed by Jonas Fay to General Gates, dated Bennington, September
22, 1771, is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By a person just arrived from Fort George—only 30 men are at that place
and 2 Gun Boats anchor’d at a distance from land and that the enemy have not more
than 3 weeks provisions.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Writing from Albany after his surrender, General Burgoyne says,
under the date of October 27, that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the 24th instant, the enemy, enabled by the capture of the gunboats and
bateaux which they had made after the surprise of the sloop, to embark upon Lake
George, attacked Diamond Island in two divisions.</p>

<p>Captain Aubrey and two companies of the 47th regiment, had been posted at
that island from the time the army passed the Hudson’s River, as a better situation
for the security of the stores at the south end of Lake George than Fort George,
which is on the continent, and not tenable against artillery and numbers. The
enemy were repulsed by Captain Aubrey with great loss, and pursued by the gunboats
under his command to the east shore, where two of their principal vessels were
retaken, together with all the cannon. They had just time to set fire to the other
bateaux and retreated over the mountains.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>This statement was based upon the report made by Lieutenant Irwine,
the commander at Lake George, whose communication appears to have
fallen into the hands of Gates, at the surrender of Burgoyne.</p>

<p>Lieutenant George Irwine, of the 47th, reports thus to Lieutenant
Francis Clark, aid-de-camp to General Burgoyne:</p>

<p>Sir
</p>

<p>I think it necessary to acquaint you for the information of General Burgoyne,
that the enemy, to the amount of two or three hundred men came from Skenesborough
to the carrying place near Tyconderoga and there took seventeen or eighteen Batteaus
with Gunboats—Their design was first to attack the fort but considering they could
not well accomplish it without cannon they desisted from that scheme, they were
then resolved to attack Diamond Island (which Island Capt. Aubrey commands) and
if they succeeded, to take this place, they began to attack the Island with cannon
about 9 o’clock yesterday morning, I have the satisfaction to inform you that after a
cannonading for near an hour and a half on both sides the enemy took to their retreat.
Then was Gun boats sent in pursuit of them which occasioned the enemy to
burn their Gun boats and Batteaus and made their escape towards Skenesborough in
great confusion—we took one Gun boat from them with a twelve pounder in her
and a good quantity of ammunition—we have heard there was a few kill’d and
many wounded of them. There was not a man killed or hurt during the whole
action of his Majesty’s Troops. I have the honor to be Sir your most obedient and

“Skeensboro Friday 11 o’clock, a. m. Sep<sup>t</sup> 26<sup>th</sup> 1777</p>

<p>Dear Sir<br>
</p>

<p>I this minute arrived at this place by the way of Fort Ann, was induced to
take this route on ac<sup>t</sup> of my Ignorance of the situation of every part of the continental
Army——</p>

<p>On the 22 ins<sup>t</sup> at 4 o’clk P.M. I set sail from the north end Lake George
with 20 sail of Boats three of which were armed, Viz one small sloop mounting 3
guns, and 2 British Gun Boats having on Board the whole about 420 Men officers
included with a Determined resolution to attack Diamond Island which lies within
5 miles Fort George at the break of Day the next Morning, but a very heavy storm
coming on prevented—I arrived Sabbath Day point abt midnight where I tarried all
night, during which time I [sic] small Boat in the fleet taken the Day before coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
from Fort George, conducted by one Ferry lately a sutler in our army, I put Ferry
on his Parole, but in the night he found Means to escape with his Boat, and informed
the Enemy of our approach, on the 23d I advanced as far as 12 Mile Island, the
Wind continuing too high for an attack I suspended it untill the Morning of the
24<sup>th</sup> at 9 oclock at which Time I advanced with the 3 armed Boats in front and the
other Boats, I ordered to wing to the Right and left of Island to attempt a landing
if practicable, and to support the Gun Boats in case they should need assistance, I
was induced to make this experiment to find the strength of the Island as also to
carry it if practicable—the enemy gave me the first fire which I returned in good
earnest, and advanced as nigh as I thought prudent, I soon found that the enemy
had been advertised of our approach and well prepared for our reception having a
great number of cannon well mounted with good Breast Works, I however approached
within a small Distance giving the Enemy as hot a fire as in my Power,
untill the sloop was hulled between wind and Water and obliged to toe her off and
one of the boats so damaged as I was obliged to quit her in the action. I had two
men killed two Mortally wounded and several others wounded in such Manner as
I was obliged to leave them under the Care of the Inhabitants, who I had taken
Prisoners giving them a sufficient reward for their services.</p>

<p>I Run my Boats up a Bay a considerable distance and burnt them with all the
Baggage that was not portable—The Enemy have on Diamond Island as near as
could be collected are about three hundred, and about 40 at Fort George with orders
if they are attacked to retreat to the Island—Gen<sup>l</sup> Borgoine has about 4 Weeks
Provision with his army and no more, he is determined to cut his Road through to
Albany at all events, for this I have the last authority, still I think him under a
small mistake—Most of the Horses and Cattle taken at Ty and thereabouts were left
in the Woods. Gen<sup>l</sup> Warner has put out a party in quest of them.</p>

given——</p>

<p>The attack on the Island continued with interruption 2 Hours.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Thus ended the fight of Diamond Island; a fight which, if attended
with better success, might have perhaps hastened the surrender of Burgoyne,
and resulted in other advantages to the American arms. As it
was, however, the British line of communication on Lake George was not
broken, while the American leaders took good care to prevent this failure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
from reaching the public ear through the press. Thus Colonel Brown’s
reports to General Lincoln remained unpublished. They have now been
brought out to be put on permanent record, as interesting material for
American history.</p>

<p>To-day the summer tourist who rows out to this lovely isle, which
commands delightful views of the lake far and wide, will see no evidences
of the struggle, but will find the very atmosphere bathed in perfect peace.
Of relics of the old wars, which for more than a hundred years caused the
air to jar, and echoing hills to complain,—there are none. The ramparts
that once bristled with cannon have been smoothed away, and the cellar
of an ancient house is all the visitor will find among the birches to tell of
the olden occupancy of man.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel John Brown (1774-1780), a native of Berkshire
county, Massachusetts, was a Yale graduate of 1771, and in 1774 visited
Canada as a horse dealer, to ascertain the sentiments of the Canadians
towards the principles of our impending Revolution. His subsequent
experiences with Arnold in the Quebec campaign are matters of history,
but his early death, in the encounter at Stone Arabia, N. Y., in 1780, just
after the discovery of Arnold’s treachery, prevented the details of his
specific accusations against the latter from becoming public. His descendants
in Boston have long been preparing to issue a detailed biography,
which should be a valuable contribution to the literature of the Revolution.
The story of his Lake George fight was practically unknown before Dr.
DeCosta’s article was written [for the N. E. Historic Genealogic Society]
and although it was afterward published in pamphlet form, so few copies
were printed that it has been inaccessible to the general reader.</p>

<p>Mr. William L. Stone furnishes me with the following particulars
regarding Captain Aubrey: He came with his regiment from Ireland to
America in 1773, and served throughout the Revolution. He commanded
his company at Bunker Hill, and when in the spring of 1776 the
regiment was sent to reinforce Carleton in Canada, he accompanied it and
aided in the expulsion of the American forces. After Burgoyne’s surrender,
Aubrey’s detachment returned to Canada and he remained there
and in command of the post at the entrance to Lake Ontario for a long
time. He died in London, January 15, 1814.—[<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> This affair was alluded to by the English, though the Americans said nothing. Among
recent writers, I have found no notice beyond that by Lossing in his Field Book, vol. i., p.

official account by Col. Brown.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> Mr. Parkman, in his work <i>The Jesuits in America</i> (p. 219), has indeed stated that
Father Jogues ascended Lake George in 1642, when, in company with Père Goupil, he was
carried away a prisoner by the Indians.</p>

<p>The opinion of Mr. Parkman is based on a manuscript account of that journey, taken down
from Father Jogues’ own lips by Father Buteux. The account, after describing the journey
southward and over Lake Champlain, which occupied eight days, says that they “arrived
at the place where one leaves the canoes” (<i>où l’on quitte les canots</i>), and then “marched
southward three days by land,” until they reached the Mohawk villages. But there is nothing
whatever in the description, by which we can recognize a passage over Lake George, nothing
about the portage, the falls, nor the outlet. Everything turns chiefly on the fact that they
<i>arrived at the place where one leaves the canoes</i>. This place, it is assumed, was the head
of Lake George, from whence there was a trail southward. Now in regard to the existence
of such a trail at that period, there can be no doubt; yet unquestionably it was not the <i>only</i>
trail followed by the Indians. The old French map shows two trails to the Mohawk villages,
one from the head of Lake George, and the other from the South-west Bay.</p>

<p>It is true that Champlain, in 1609, intended to go to the Mohawk country, by Lake
George, yet at the period of Jogue’s captivity we have no account of any one taking that
route. Father Jogues himself clearly did not cross the lake in 1646. It is distinctly said
that they arrived at the end of the lake (<i>bout de lac</i>) on the eve of the Festival of <i>St.
Sacrament</i>, when they named the lake, and the next day went south <i>on foot</i>, carrying their
packs on their backs. This is the view given by every one who has treated the subject in
print, including Mr. Parkman himself.</p>

<p>To this it has been answered that <i>bout de lac</i> always means the <i>head</i> of the lake, and that
the terms are so used in the <i>Relations</i>; yet if we return to the <i>Relations</i> of 1668 (vol. ii.,
p. 5), detailing the journey of Fathers Fremin, Pieron and Bruyas, we find that this is not
the case. The writer there says that while he and others delayed on an island in Lake
Champlain, the boatmen went forward, “landing at the <i>end</i> of the Lake (<i>bout de lac</i>) du
St. Sacrement, and preparing for the portage.” At this place, the north end of the lake,
there is a heavy portage, in order to get around the Falls of Ticonderoga. In the next
sentence he again calls this end of the lake, which is the north end or outlet, <i>bout de lac</i>.
But we have also to remind the reader, that the place where Father Jogues <i>left his canoe</i>, in
1646, was at the north end of the lake (the foot), which he, like the others, calls <i>bout de lac</i>.
The language is so translated by Parkman and others who have mentioned the circumstances.
<i>Bout de lac</i>, in the Jesuit <i>Relations</i>, therefore does not mean the <i>head</i> of the lake. We see,
then, that we have not sufficient reason for supposing that “the place where one leaves the
canoes” meant the head, or south end of Lake George, and consequently that the alleged
passage over the lake by Jogues, in 1642, is indefensible.</p>

<p>[The following legend was obtained from the lips of a Chippewa woman named
Penaqua, or the Female Pheasant, and I hardly know which to admire most, the simple
beauty of the plot, or the graphic and unique manner of the narrative, of which, I regret to
say, I can hardly give a faithful translation.]</p>
</div>

<p>Among the rivers of the North, none can boast of more numerous
charms than the St. Louis, and the fairest spot of the earth which it
waters is that where now (1847) stands the trading post of Fond
du Lac. Upon this spot, many summers ago, there lived a Chippewa chief
and his wife, who were the parents of an only daughter. Her name was
<i>Sweet Strawberry</i>, and she was acknowledged to be the most beautiful
maiden of her nation. Her voice was like that of the turtle-dove, and the
red deer was not more graceful and sprightly in its form. Her eyes were
brilliant as the star of the northern sky, which guides the hunter through
the wilderness, and her dark hair clustered around her neck like grape
vines around the trunk of the tree they loved. The young men of
every nation had striven to win her heart, but she smiled upon none.
Curious presents were sent to her from the four quarters of the world,
but she received them not. Seldom did she deign to reply to the many
warriors who entered her father’s lodge, and when she did, it was only
to assure them that while upon earth she would never change her condition.
Her strange conduct astonished them, but did not subdue their
affection. Many and noble were the deeds they performed, not only in
winning the white plumes of the eagle, but in hunting the elk and the
black bear. But all their exploits availed them nothing, for the heart of
the beautiful girl was still untouched.</p>

<p>The snows of winter were all gone, and the pleasant winds of spring
were blowing over the land. The time for making sugar had arrived,
though the men had not yet returned from the remote hunting grounds,
and in the maple forests bright fires were burning, and the fragrance of
the sweet sap filled all the air. The ringing laugh of childhood and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
mature song of women, were heard in the valley, but in no part of the
wilderness could be found more happiness than on the banks of the St.
Louis. But the <i>Sweet Strawberry</i> mingled with the young men and
maidens of her tribe, in a thoughtful mood and with downcast eyes. She
was evidently bowed down by some mysterious grief, but she neglected
not her duties; and though she spent much of her time alone, her buchère-bucket
was as frequently filled with the sugar juice as any of her companions.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of affairs, when a party of young warriors
from the far North came upon a frolic to the St. Louis River. Having
seen the many handsome maidens of this region, the strangers became
enamored of their charms, and each one succeeded in obtaining the love of
a maiden, who was to become his bride during the marrying season of
summer.</p>

<p>The warriors had heard of the <i>Sweet Strawberry</i>, but, neglected by
all of them, she was still doomed to remain alone. She witnessed the
happiness of her old playmates, and, wondering at her own strange fate,
spent much of her time in solitude. She even became so unhappy and
bewildered that she heeded not the tender words of her mother, and from
that time the music of her voice was never heard.</p>

<p>The sugar making season was now rapidly passing away, but the
brow of the <i>Sweet Strawberry</i> was still overshadowed with grief. Everything
was done to restore her to her wonted cheerfulness, but she remained
unchanged. Wild ducks in innumerable numbers arrived with every
southern wind, and settled upon the surrounding waters, and proceeded
to build their nests in pairs, and the Indian maiden sighed over her
mysterious doom. On one occasion she espied a cluster of early spring
flowers peering above the dry leaves of the forest, and, strange to say, even
these were separated into pairs, and seemed to be wooing each other in
love. All things whispered to her of love, the happiness of her companions,
the birds of the air, and the flowers. She looked into her heart,
and inwardly praying for a companion whom she might love, the Master
of Life took pity upon her lot and answered her prayer.</p>

<p>It was now the twilight hour, and in the maple woods the Indian
boys were watching their fires and the women were bringing in the sap
from the surrounding trees. The time for making sugar was almost
gone, and the well-filled mocucks, which might be seen in all the wigwams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
testified that the yield had been abundant. The hearts of the old women
beat in thankfulness, and the young men and maidens were already beginning
to anticipate the pleasures of wedded life and those associated
with the sweet summer time. But the brow of the <i>Sweet Strawberry</i>
continued to droop, and her friends looked upon her as a victim of a
settled melancholy. Her duties, however, were performed without a
murmur, and so continued to be performed until the trees refused to fill
her buchère-bucket with sap, when she stole away from the sugar camp
and wandered to a retired place to muse upon her sorrows. Her unaccountable
grief was very bitter, but did not long endure; for, as she stood
gazing upon the sky, the moon ascended above the hills and filled her soul
with a joy she had never felt before. The longer she looked upon the
brilliant object, the more deeply in love did she become with its celestial
charms, and she burst forth into a song—a loud, wild, and joyous song.
Her musical voice echoed through the woods, and her friends hastened to
ascertain the cause. They gathered around her in crowds, but she heeded
them not. They wondered at the wildness of her words, and the airy-like
appearance of her form. They were spellbound by the scene before
them, but their astonishment knew no limits when they saw her
gradually ascend from the earth into the air, where she disappeared, as
if borne upward by the evening wind. And then it was that they discovered
her clasped in the embraces of the moon, for they knew that the
spots which they saw within the circle of that planet were those of her
robe, which she had made from the skins of the spotted fawn.</p>

<p>Many summers have passed away since the <i>Sweet Strawberry</i> became
the Maiden of the Moon, yet among all the people of her nation
is she ever remembered for her beauty and the mystery of her being.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FIRST_WOMAN_IN_THE_POST_OFFICE_DEPARTMENT">THE FIRST WOMAN IN THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT</h2>
</div>


<p>Just the other day, during a housecleaning in the Post Office Department,
a number of autograph letters written by men famous in
American history were discovered in an old and battered file-case.
The file-case had evidently been considered of no value, for it had been
stowed away in a little-used portion of the cellar, and would undoubtedly
have eventually been broken up and its contents lost or destroyed.</p>

<p>The papers include letters of recommendation by Horace Greeley,
Garfield, Sumner, and others of then national prominence. Among the
papers was the record of the first woman appointed to the postal service
and one of the first employed in the Government departments in Washington
in any capacity.</p>

<p>The documents are considered as of more than ordinary interest,
particularly as autograph letters of recommendation from prominent men
are now practically things of the past. The general use of the typewriter,
and the fact that almost every man of prominence has a private secretary,
are largely responsible for this modern condition.</p>

<p>Autograph letters of recommendation, moreover, are not looked
upon with favor in Government departments nowadays, and a missive from
Horace Greeley such as the one on file would probably be thrown in the
waste basket as undecipherable. The appearance of this letter justifies
all things that were ever said about the great editor’s chirography.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting papers in the collection is an autograph
letter written by Elisha Whittlesey of the comptroller’s office in the Treasury
Department, to Montgomery Blair, then Postmaster General, which
resulted in the appointment of the first woman employee of the postal
service and the second to be employed by any Government department in
Washington. The letter follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author3">
“Treasury Department, Comptroller’s Office,</p>
<p class="author">December 23, 1861.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Having understood you had decided to employ females in the
dead letter office under a recent act of Congress authorizing you to employ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
an additional force, I present for your consideration the application of
Miss Elizabeth Johnson of Cleveland, Ohio, who now and for some
months past has been in this city.</p>

<p>She is a young lady, well educated, well behaved, and a member of
the Presbyterian Church. Her father died some years since, leaving a
widow and a large family of children.</p>

<p>Elizabeth D. was born in New Orleans, teaching school when the
seceding States withdrew. Not disposing to remain there, she was protected
by the colonel of a regiment from New Orleans to Richmond, who
was acquainted with her. From Richmond she went to Norfolk, whence
she came to Fortress Monroe with a trunk and flag of truce, from thence
to Baltimore in the regular steamer, and from there here by railroad. A
trunk containing her winter clothing was put in charge of a gentleman
who came to this city and lost it between Richmond and Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p>The little money that she has is now exhausted, and she is in debt for
a few weeks past. She is the person of whom an account was given at the
time in the papers as having created a sensation on board of the boat by
hurrahing when she first saw the stars and stripes on Fortress Monroe.
Of her loyalty there can be no doubt, and for it I will be responsible.</p>

<p>It seems to me that you will not have a case that will appeal more
strongly to your sense of justice nor to your sympathy or kindness. I was
acquainted with her ancestors in Connecticut, and have seen her in Cleveland.
Her application is before you and I hope it will prevail. I should
have waited on you in person if I could leave the office without disappointing
those creditors of the United States who are waiting for their money.</p>

<p>The Hon. Mr. Theaker is acquainted with Miss Johnson, and will
wait on you in her behalf.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Elisha Whittlesey.</span><br>
</p>

<p>P. S.—Mr. Theaker has heard of the death of his wife in Bridgeport,
Ohio, and has left for his home. Prof. Donald McLean, a clerk
in this office, will wait on you with this letter, and he is also acquainted
with Miss Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair made the desired appointment, and Mr. Whittlesey’s letter
bears the following endorsement in the Postmaster General’s handwriting:</p>

<p>“Somewhat mixed, but his heart is in the right place. Recommendation
approved.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HAND-LOOM_WEAVING_REVIVED">HAND-LOOM WEAVING REVIVED</h2>
</div>


<p>Seated on a thick oak plank, worn smooth and shiny by centuries
of use as the seat of a hand loom, and with Mrs. Talbot seated on a
similar plank in front of a second loom in the basement of his
residence, No. 193 Power Street, Arnold G. Talbot, secretary of the Tockwotton
Company, and well known in social circles of the East Side, has
become a hand loom weaver. Side by side, with a light between them
and another in each of the front corners of the little room, Mr. and Mrs.
Talbot sit every week day evening and weave plain and pattern goods in
silk, linen and cotton, on the looms and in the fashions of two centuries
ago.</p>

<p>They do it partly for amusement and partly to satisfy an increasing
demand for such goods as our grandmothers wove, among people
with so much money that it is really doing them a service to separate them
from some of it. They have what is probably the only hand loom establishment
in this State, a practical exposition of the spread and possibilities
of the modern arts and crafts movement. It is right in line with the
present movement for hand work in wearing materials or house fabrics by
those able to pay the necessarily increased cost.</p>

<p>In fact there are but few such establishments in this country. In
the mountains of Kentucky hand weaving is still practiced, and the products
of the mountaineers, handled through a semi-public institution, have
a ready sale. In Massachusetts such goods are also selling. Mr. and
Mrs. Talbot first thought of the possibilities of remunerative trade when
they found a demand for hand weaving among friends who saw the results
of their work of three hours every evening—from seven to ten o’clock—on
the one loom with which they began work. Then they procured another
loom in Johnston, the town from which the first one came, and set that up
beside the one Mr. Talbot had bought as a curiosity. Now they have
hired a Swede woman to come to work at the loom during the day. In
Sweden all the girls are still taught in the country districts to operate a
hand loom, and this woman has not been in this country long enough to
forget what she was taught as a girl.</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot believes in old things. It is said by friends that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
is nothing modern in his house except the present members of the family.
He has one of the most strikingly beautiful mantels imaginable, taken from
one of the old houses on South Main Street, in which the quality of the
old town of Providence once lived, and his son and heir even sleeps in one
of the trundle beds of song and story. So when a friend told him of the
auction of goods of a collector of antiques in Johnston he went to the sale.
No one else seemed to want the old hand loom there offered, so Mr. Talbot
bought it, just for the sake of getting an unusual antique.</p>

<p>There must be many such looms in the garrets of the South County
and other sections of the State, where they were shoved to one side half or
three-quarters of a century ago, but few of them are set up and in working
order as this one was. Mr. Talbot had the loom brought to his home and
then started to put it together again. What he did not know about looms
was vast and comprehensive, and Mrs. Talbot’s knowledge was equally
vain. But together and with the help of a friend or two whose working
idea of mechanics was as great as the Talbot willingness to learn, they
finally had it set up in the room Mr. Talbot had used for his den. Then
they went to work to learn how to run the thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot has a wide acquaintance among mill men, and some of
them volunteered to come to the Talbot home and show them how to read
patterns, that they might reproduce old hand-loom designs. So they
came, and were given some hand-made goods to read. One by one they confessed
that, while they could read any machine-woven pattern, the difference
in the methods of the machine and the hand looms was great enough
to puzzle them. They could not read the patterns, that is, tell how they
were woven—so many threads this way, so many that way, and the rest.
They gave it up. Mrs. Talbot, who had a rare combination of gumption
and energy, tackled the problem and puzzled it out. She picked up a little
here and a little there, and was soon weaving, and weaving patterns, at
that.</p>

<p>This was early last October. The first loom had no sooner been
set up and started than Mr. and Mrs. Talbot found a new difficulty. The
work was fascinating, the hours they had to give to it were few, and each
wanted to use the loom at about the same time. So Mr. Talbot commissioned
the man he had bought it from to find and buy another for them.
The second one was found in Johnston, the town from which the first had
come, and was set up beside the other. After that they peacefully wove
every evening side by side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>They had to work everything out from the beginning. Their thread
they bought, but they had to build a warping frame, after the old fashion,
and warp and link the thread themselves, running four threads at a time,
up and down the warping frame. It takes them about four hours to wind
fifty yards of warp for forty-inch cloth. Warping the yarn is the most
essential feature of the whole process, for if it is not done well, the yarn
will not feed easily, and the weaving will be stopped.</p>

<p>Everything about the looms, except the operators and the harnesses,
is old. The harnesses, which came with the looms, were of cord, and the
new ones are superior. The reeds used in the looms are of split reed, and
Mrs. Talbot considers them better than the modern ones of steel. The
looms themselves are built of white oak, and as their history is known,
Mr. Talbot is safe in the statement that they are each more than 200 years
old. He has even procured the square and compasses with which they
were built. One loom is used for plain weaving, the other one for pattern
work.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Talbot have named it the Hearthside Loom, a charmingly
descriptive name, and have already produced some very handsome
patterns, some of them copies of old patterns of two centuries ago, some
of them from Mrs. Talbot’s ideas, or from patterns made by Mr. Talbot
for their original work. They have found a good demand for their products
at prices ranging from $3 a yard for tabbie weaving—the straight
up and down, plain weaving—to about $5 a yard for silk goods. In
linen, which costs $2.50 a yard, they use all imported Irish linen, the
American linen lacking the property of lasting, the oil having been extracted
from it. Wool patterns and patterns in imported cloth are worth
$6 a yard, with plain wool weaving forty or forty-five inches wide, at $4
a yard, and scrim curtains at $6 a pair.</p>

<p>A good woman weaver can weave about four yards of linen a day,
or about five yards of wool a day, on such looms as these. The Hearthside
Loom takes orders for pattern work on original patterns, and its
work has already proved popular among people who are able to buy goods
made to last. In addition to the two large looms, Mr. Talbot has a small
ribbon loom that is even older than the larger ones, while the trade-mark
of the establishment is a reproduction of a hand loom small enough to
be held in one hand, and hardly bigger than a large shingle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>The room in which they are placed is a veritable curiosity shop. On
the wall hangs the long crane from the old glebe house of St. John’s
Church, torn down last year, with other iron fire pieces; at the hearth are
old iron fire dogs; all along the rear wall hang other antiques. The house
is filled with old and curious things, none older or more curious, however,
than the looms forming the working machinery of the Hearthside Loom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BALTIMORES_OLD_STEPPING-STONES">BALTIMORE’S OLD STEPPING-STONES</h2>
</div>


<p>In the midst of the enterprise and activity that mark the Baltimore of
to-day, visitors frequently come across old landmarks that stand out
distinctly as reminders of the earlier and more leisurely days of the
city’s history. None of them is more familiar than the old-fashioned
stepping-stones still to be seen at a few crossings, usually at the bottom
of the steepest grades, and which become veritable Ararats of refuge
when the streets are flooded after a heavy rain. Worn smooth on top
by thousands of scurrying feet that now are still, chipped and scarred at
the corners by hundreds of whirling wheels long since rotted, and streaked
and pitted on the sides by the winter snows and summer rains of countless
yesterdays, the stepping-stone stands amid the busy street like a milestone
on the road that Greater Baltimore has trod—like the tombstone
of the dead past.</p>

<p>Nowadays the most prominent of these old stepping-stones are at
the foot of the hill below the town house of Secretary of the Navy Bonaparte,
at Centre Street and Park Avenue.</p>

<p>There are traces of the stones still left on the steep grade of Saratoga
Street, down from Courtland to Calvert, and there are some of
these stones at North Avenue, near the Mount Royal Avenue entrance
to the park, and their usefulness has been demonstrated more than once
during the heavy downpours that have characterized this season’s rains.</p>

<p>Probably the best-known of the stepping-stones were those opposite
the site of the old Hall of Congress, on what is now Baltimore Street,
between Sharp and Liberty, at which the sessions of the Continental Congress
were held in December, 1776.</p>

<p>Speaking of these old landmarks, Col. William H. Love said:</p>

<p>“For many years Baltimore and Fredericksburg, Va., shared with
Pompeii the distinction of having stepping-stones across the public highways.
Some years ago, when ex-Mayor Latrobe and his father, the late
John H. B. Latrobe, were visiting Pompeii, the elder Mr. Latrobe
said: ‘Ferdinand, do you see anything familiar?’ Mr. Latrobe said
that he suddenly felt at home; he saw some old stepping-stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Some years ago, if I am not mistaken, there were stepping-stones
at the crossings on Lexington Street leading toward Liberty, and on
Liberty at the crossings all the way down to Lombard Street. They
were the cause of some painful accidents to children who were crossing
and slipped, cutting their faces badly. But as a rule they could not have
been dispensed with, because of the enormous body of water that came
down the streets when it rained in those days.</p>

<p>The flow of water was especially strong down Baltimore Street,
and the old stones opposite Congress Hall I remember well. The stones
were quite high at the curb and were somewhat lower near the center of
the street. I have known the rush of water to be so great down Baltimore
Street at that point that traffic was altogether stopped by it until the
storm was over.”</p>

<p>The grave of Daniel Shipman, who is generally believed to have
been the original of Cooper’s Leather Stocking, has been definitely
located in the Adams cemetery at Fly Creek, near Cooperstown,
N. Y. A committee has been appointed for the purpose of
erecting a suitable tablet to mark the grave, which is now merely covered
with a large flat stone with no inscription whatever.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(At a recent meeting of the Saratoga County Society, Mr. William L. Stone made an
address on the subject of the battle, from which we make an excerpt.—Ed.)</p>
</div>


<p>This event (which has been called by Creasy one of the fifteen decisive
battles of the world) secured for us the French alliance; and
lifted the cloud of moral and financial gloom that had settled upon
the hearts of the people, dampening the hopes of the leaders of the Revolution,
and wringing despairing words even from the hopeful Washington.</p>

<p>More than a century has elapsed since that illustrious event. All
the actors in the drama have passed away, and their descendants are now
sharing in the rewards of their devotion and suffering. And now after
years of labor a noble shaft has arisen at Schuylerville to commemorate
that turning point of our National destiny; which, like those of Lexington
and Bunker Hill, tells of one of the earliest bloodsheds in the cause of
Cisatlantic freedom, and makes the selfsacrifice of our ancestors endure
in granite records for the admiration of generations yet to be.</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact, in connection with the Battles of Saratoga,
that, until recently, there has been no map of the battle-ground from an
American standpoint (Neilson’s is the same as no map), our only means
of information being those maps made by Burgoyne’s engineers [these
were then shown by the speaker] and which were published in 1781 to
illustrate Burgoyne’s defence when he was tried in Parliament for his
defeat at Saratoga. But, within a few years, there has been found a map
of the battle-ground, by General Rufus Putnam, which throws great light
on one point in particular, viz.: It has always been a mystery, as I say
in my “Burgoyne’s Campaign,” why Gates did not renew the battle on the
next day, the 8th. But from this map [here the speaker exhibited the
map, which has never been published] it appears that the ravines at Wilbur’s
Basin had been so fortified by the British, that (to quote from the
map in Putnam’s handwriting) “These defences (<i>i. e.</i>: on these ravines)
thus fortified, prevented our attack on the British the next day.”</p>

<p>It is also of interest, as showing the good judgment of Burgoyne’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
engineers, that the roads which they cut through the (at that time)
primeval forest, are the same that the farmers and road commissioners
adopted for their present roads—the one, for instance, from Victory Mills
to Quaker Springs, on the high ridge which Fraser took, while Burgoyne
and Riedesel took the river bank.</p>

<p>On the 23d of December, 1782, I went on board of the <i>Triomphant</i>,
eighty guns with M. de Viomenil, and on the 24th the whole
squadron, carrying the army, set sail and left the harbor of Boston;
the channel is narrow and has little depth; so that we were not without
uneasiness. Our pilot himself did not appear to be quite composed
and incessantly repeated orders. However, we fortunately got through;
one only of the transport ships was shattered upon the rocks on setting
sail; happily, there were not troops on board. We were to cruise as high
up as Portsmouth, a pretty good port beyond Boston, where two ships of
war were, which were to rejoin us and then to cruise alongside of Rhode
Island in order to meet with the <i>Fantasque</i>, a vessel armed <i>en flute</i>. The
bad weather changed these designs; we could not, without danger, remain
upon these coasts exposed to being cast away upon them or driven upon
sand banks.</p>

<p>On the 27th, the frigate <i>Iris</i> left us, to proceed to France. On the
same day we lost sight of our convoy and our frigate. Moreover, every
vessel carried a sealed package pointing out the general destination of the
squadron.</p>

<p>The staff of the <i>Triomphant</i> consisted of thirteen officers. Three
auxiliary and three officers of the regiment Médoc, keeping garrison in
the ship, who, with the officers who were passengers made fifty-five persons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
The soldiers and sailors were in proportion, so that there were
more than eleven hundred persons on board of this ship. We also had
on board the famous Paul Jones, who had asked permission to embark on
board of us, who behaved with great propriety.</p>

<p>February, 1783. On the 8th, several of our ships were obliged to
put into port at Curacoa. The squadron finally sailed for France, April
4th, arrived at Brest 17th of June.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen.</span>—I have been honored with your favors of the 13th
14th and 17th instants. My late absence from the Army prevented my
acknowledging them sooner.</p>

<p>If the Uniforms which were fixed upon for the Troops of North and
South Carolina have not been ordered from Europe, I do not see that
any inconvenience can attend the proposed alteration. I think, however,
the Lace ought to be dispensed with as altogether superfluous and very
expensive.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable that a due proportion should be observed
between the pay of the Deputies and the principal in any department,
and as Congress were pleased to augment the Salary of Mr Laurance the
Judge Advocate General very considerably by the Resolve of the 10th
of November there can I think be no impropriety in augmenting the
Salaries of the Deputies also to 60 dolls p. month, which is what they
request.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton has informed me that it is not in his power to
permit the transportation of Tobacco from Virginia to Charlestown. I
imagine there are some commercial Regulations in the way. But he says
that he mentioned certain Articles to Colo Magaw and Colo Ely which
might be sent in and sold for the benefit of our prisoners. What they
were I do not exactly recollect, but I think Lumber and Iron.</p>

<p>[Letter of John Dickinson, member of the Continental Congress, to the President of Congress,
in reference to the mutiny of the army, when the soldiers had surrounded and threatened

<p class="ph4">THE FIRST U. S. FLAG</p>

<p>The first Stars and Stripes were displayed
at Fort Schuyler (the present
Rome, N. Y.), August 5, 1777. This
much every schoolboy is supposed [it is
very much of a supposition, however, how
many in the average High School could
tell the story off-hand—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] to know.
What is not generally known is that this
historic flag is still in existence; being in
the possession of Mrs. Abram Lansing,
of Albany, N. Y., a grand-daughter of
Colonel Gansevoort, and who possesses
also the original of the following letter:</p>

<p>Dear Sir:<br>
</p>

<p>The great distance which your duty
calls us apart obliges me at this time to
give you this trouble which otherwise I
would not. You may remember I was to
have an order for eight yards of broadcloth
on the commissary for clothing of
this State, in lieu of my blue cloak <i>which
was used for colours at Fort Schuyler</i>.
An opportunity now presenting itself, I
beg (you) to send me an order enclosed
to Jeremiah Van Rensselaer, paymaster
at Albany, or to Henry Van Vaughter,
Albany, where I will receive it, and you
will oblige one who will always acknowledge
the same with true gratitude</p>

<p>Please to make my compliments to the
other officers of the regiment</p>

here referred to we read:
“Though there is no positive evidence
that any of the inhabitants of Billerica
were put upon trial for the supposed
crime of witchcraft in the time of this
delusion, yet it may be safely inferred
that several were suspected and one or
two apprehended. Besides the authority
of Hutchinson, the town records inform
us that during the height of the delusion,
two persons were in the prison at Cambridge,
and that they both died there.
Rebecca, wife of William Chamberlain,
died there Sept. 26, 1692, and John
Durant, Oct. 27, 1692. They were
probably both victims of the infatuation
which prevailed at that time.”</p>

<p>The writer has made a careful examination
of the original court files of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>

and finds nothing for or against Farmer’s
statements. However, John Farmer, a
native of the town of Chelmsford, adjoining
Billerica, does not write as
though this phase of his subject were
traditional with him, but rather conjectural.</p>

<p>WEYMOUTH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.
<span class="smcap">Wessagusset and Weymouth</span>,
an historical address by
Charles Francis Adams, Jr., delivered
at Weymouth, July 4, 1874, on the
occasion of the celebration of the Two
Hundred and Fiftieth Anniversary of
the Permanent Settlement of the
Town. <span class="smcap">Weymouth in its First
Twenty Years</span>, a paper read before
the Society by Gilbert Nash, November
1, 1882. <span class="smcap">Weymouth Thirty
Years Later</span>, a paper read by Charles
Francis Adams, before the Weymouth
Historical Society, September 23,
1904. Published by the <span class="smcap">Weymouth
Historical Society</span>, 1905. 8vo, pp.
164.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the beginning of his second paper in
this volume, Mr. Adams tells how it came
about that he delivered his first address at
Weymouth thirty years before, never having
given thought to independent historical investigations
before he was invited by the
town to deliver the historical address on the
occasion of the 250th anniversary. He confesses
that at that time he hardly knew where
the town was, much less anything of its history.
The acceptance of that invitation, he
states, marked a turning point in his life
which had previously been devoted to civil
and military affairs, and he expresses gratitude
to Weymouth because the path into historical
research, thus unexpectedly opened to
him, has led him for thirty years through
pastures green and pleasant places. Besides
affording him pleasure, it has brought him
honors in new fields of usefulness, and his
labors have been profitable to students of
Massachusetts history. The mature outcome
of the earlier address was presented in print
a dozen years ago in a two-volume work
called, “Three Episodes of Massachusetts
History.”</p>

<p>In the later address Mr. Adams is merciless
in his destruction of the myth known as
“The March of Miles Standish.” The familiar
poem is shown to be without any historical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
support, the “march” having taken
place by boat!</p>

<p>Speaking of this incident in Weymouth history,
he says, “It smacks of the savage; it
is racy of the soil; it smells of the sea. It
begins with the flight of Phineas Pratt from
Wessagusset to Plymouth, his loss of the way,
his fear lest his foot-prints in the late-lingering
snow banks should betray him, his nights
in the woods, his pursuit by the Indians, his
guidance by the stars and sky, his fording
the icy river, and his arrival in Plymouth
just as Miles Standish was embarking for
Wessagusset. Nothing then can be more picturesque,
more epic in outline, than Standish’s
voyage, with his little company of
grim, silent men in that open boat. Sternly
bent on action, they skirted, under a gloomy
eastern sky, along the surf-beaten shore, the
mist driving in their faces as the swelling
seas broke roughly in white surge over the
rocks and ledges which still obstruct the
course they took. From the distance came
the dull, monotonous roar of the breakers,
indicating the line of the coast. At last they
cast anchor before the desolate and apparently
deserted block-house here in your Fore river,
and presently some woe-begone stragglers
answered their call. Next came the meeting
with the savages, the fencing talk, and the
episode of what Holmes, in still another
poem, refers to as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Wituwamet’s pictured knife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Pecksuot’s whooping shout;’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>all closing with the fierce hand-to-hand death
grapple on the blood-soaked, slippery floor
of the rude stockade. Last of all the return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
to Plymouth, with the gory head of Wattawamat,
‘that bloody and bold villain,’ a
ghastly freight, stowed in the rummage of
their boat.... That Longfellow wrote
very sweet verse none will deny; but, assuredly,
he was not Homeric. At his hands
your Weymouth history failed to have justice
done it. The case is, I fear, irremediable.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its many variations from
the historical facts, the poet’s version of this
affair, because of its poetical setting, is probably
destined to be the only version to be
widely known outside of the limited circle of
historical students.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams endeavors to establish as a
fixed fact in Massachusetts history that Weymouth
as a permanent European settlement
antedated Boston by at least six years; and,
moreover, that this fact has singular historical
interest. That it was a struggle for possession
between two forms of civilization and
of religious faith; one being ecclesiastical
and feudal, the other theological and democratic;
the fate of the two settlements during
the earlier and crucial period depending not
on events in Massachusetts, but upon a
struggle for supremacy going on in England.
“Gorges represented Charles I; Winthrop,
the Parliament. If the fortune of war had
turned otherwise than it did turn, and Charles
I. had emerged from the conflict victorious,
there can be little question Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, and not John Winthrop, would have
shaped the destiny of Massachusetts. Its history
would then have been wholly other than
New England will find much of interest in
it was.”</p>

<p>Students will find much of interest in
the three papers printed in this volume.</p>
